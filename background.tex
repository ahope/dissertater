\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}
This chapter covers background material that informs this dissertation. This primarily consists of the psychological and cognitive theories of behavior, learning and change that relate to self-monitoring. These theories inform the design of interventions to change behavior, either in general or specifically for nutrition behaviors. This background will highlight the role and importance of self-monitoring as a tool for nutrition behavior change. Included in this background is persuasive technology, which uses the aforementioned theories to define strategies and tactics of employing technology to nudge behavior. 

 This chapter will introduce the various theories and related concepts that impact the design and evaluation of the self-monitoring tools presented in this dissertation. 

\section{Introduction}



\section{Behavior Change}
In this section, I review some relevant theories in regards to behavior change. 

\subsection{Theory of Planned Behavior} 
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is a model of individual behavior that assumes a person is a rational actor. It builds off the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA states that a person's behavior is determined by behavioral intention. Behavioral intention depends on attitude (individual beliefs about a behavior) and a subjective norm. The subjective norm stems from the individual's normative beliefs, which is defined as whether influential parties approve or disapprove of the behavior in question. 

This is embodied in the real world by:
* Calculating attitude:
	* measuring likelihood that a target behavior will result in a specific outcome. 
	* Evaluating the [attractiveness] of an outcome (whether the outcome is good or bad). 
	* combine the above two items for each potential outcome of a behavior. 
	* combine all the combinations to determine the individual's attitude toward that change. 
* Calculating normative beliefs:
	* For each identified referent (parent, doctor, peer...):
		* The individual rates how the referent feels about the individual performing the target behavior. 
		* The individual rates how much influence that referent has on their behavior (ie, ``I agree that I want to do what my doctor thinks I should do''). 
		* combine the above two items. 
	* Combine the results for each referent. 

The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) extends TRA by including a component of volitional control. Volitional control captures the individual's ability to exercise control over the target behavior. Volitional control is included in the model by perceived behavioral control. If the individual perceives a great amount of behavioral control, then motivation (as characterized by TRA) drives the individual's performance of the target behavior. If the individual perceives little control over their ability to execute the target behavior, the individual expends less effort in pursuit of the target behavior. Perceived control depends on control beliefs and perceived power of each belief. 
 
\subsection{Enabling change: Social Cognitive Theory}
Social Cognitive Theory \citep{bandura_health_2004, bandura_self-efficacy:_1977} posits that a person뭩 behavior, environment and inner qualities all contribute to how a person functions. This theory has been applied to understanding how people learn, how social environments impact what people do, and how people regulate their own behavior. A key component in this theory is self-efficacy, which is summarized as a belief in one뭩 abilities.

Self-efficacy is traditionally measured by self-report. To develop self-efficacy measurements for a particular domain, researchers use open-ended approaches to identify common challenges and barriers to the problem. They then develop a series of statements of the form ``How confident are you that you can [achieve goal] even though [challenge]?'' with a 4-unit response scale ranging from ``Cannot do it'' to ``Highly certain can do''. An example of a statement is ``How confident are you that you can stick to a healthy eating plan after a long, tiring day at work?''

Research shows self-efficacy measures based on self-report indicate adherence to strategies to change behavior \citep{nothwehr_self-efficacy_2008}. While short-term studies cannot prove behavior change, self-efficacy measures provides valuable feedback about whether an intervention is supporting adherence to behavior change strategies, and indicate whether participants complete the study with an intention to continue.

This is an important feature for PI researchers: we are familiar with a domain and common challenges, so can build the scales easily; we usually use short-term studies to indicate long-term impact; and properly designed scales can help us to discover where a PI tool breaks down.

\subsection{Motivation for change: Transtheoretical Model}
The transtheoretical model (TTM) \citep{prochaska_transtheoretical_1997} reflects that people are in varying stages of change in relation to a given behavior. The stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance and termination. 

\subsection{Supporting change: Goal setting and tending}
Here I talk about Locke and Latham \citep{locke_building_2002} and Consolvo and Landay \citep{consolvo_goal-setting_2009}. Goal theory. How to define goals. How to support progress toward goals. 

\subsection{Self-Monitoring and Change}

First, I'll talk about what self-monitoring of dietary intake is, and what is involved. Self-monitoring of dietary intake is the process that an individual uses to keep track of what they eat. The self-monitoring process is impacted by both the tool or instrument used for self-monitoring and the individual doing the self-monitoring. In regards to the individual, the process of self-monitoring involves cognitive processes, and the ability or willingness to continue self-monitoring involves individual goals, motivation, and resources.   The design of the tool impacts the process by clarifying (communicating? reminding?) goals as well as responding to individual motivation and resources. 


Research consistently supports that self-monitoring helps to mediate behavior change. Indeed, \citet{kanfer_self-monitoring:_1970} states ``self-observation is an initial step to self-directed behavior change''. Much research in this area falls outside the scope of this chapter, but in the domain of weight-loss, people who adhere to consistent self-monitoring of dietary intake lose more weight and have better indicators of related behaviors. Burke et al and the PREFER trial. WHI. \citep{greaves_systematic_2011}

It is unclear how self-monitoring impacts behavior change, or what mediates the process of self-monitoring. This is primarily due to limitations in the ability to evaluate the self-monitoring process. \citep{Baranowski1994, kanfer_self-monitoring:_1970, burke_self-monitoring_2005, glanz_improving_2006}. 

Later in this chapter I further explore how electronic self-monitoring tools for dietary intake are evaluated. 

\subsection{Self-Monitoring for Health}
Self-monitoring has been key to supporting lifestyle behavior changes necessary for treating cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and renal disease. 

Electronic self-monitoring has advantages over pencil and paper self-monitoring. 

Certain lifestyle behaviors can help to prevent disease as well as treat it. 

Since many of the behavior changes relate to nutrition and dietary intake, much research focuses on this. However, nutrition literature demonstrates that brief monitoring of the behaviors can still be effective. The technology domain has not put much emphasis on investigating brief monitoring instruments. 

Self-monitoring can help people make the behavior changes that prevent disease. 

The cognitive processes involved in the recall of food have been described in children as \citep{Baranowski1994}:
    Attention
    Perception
    Organisation
    Retention
    Retrieval
    Response formulation
People need to attend to the food that they are eating, at the time they eat it, in order to perceive it. The food information then needs to be organized and stored for retention. Then, the food information needs to be retrieved, and formulated into a response or action (e.g. creating a record). 

\subsection{Technology and Behavior Change (Persuasive Technology)}
In this section, talk about the body of work that has looked at how to use technology to support behavior change. Persuasive technology \citep{Fogg2002} and theory-driven technology \citep{consolvo_theory-driven_2009}. 

\section{Approaches to Changing Nutrition Behaviors}
Here I describe some standard approaches and theories nutritionists use to inform behaviors change to provide as background for reference later in this dissertation. It is not an exhaustive list. 

\subsection{Motivational Interviewing}
Motivational interviewing (MI) \citep{miller_motivational_2002, Miller2002} is a process practitioners use to identify what areas of change an individual is ready for. It is a technique employing goal setting, feedback mechanisms, and self-monitoring. There are three key elements: collaboration rather than confrontation; evoking ideas rather than imposing ideas; and autonomy rather than authority. In addition are four principles to follow: express empathy, support self-efficacy, roll with resistance, and ``develop discrepancy'' (or identify cognitive dissonance). 

MI has a strong record of impact for many types of behavior change \citep{Rubak2005}. It is particularly effective and well respected in the area of nutrition behavior changes \citep{abraham_taxonomy_2008, michie_effective_2009, greaves_systematic_2011}. 

\subsection{CBT Programs}
Cognitive-Behavioral Training (CBT) teaches people how to change the way they think about their nutrition behaviors to support them in the change. 

\subsection{Other techniques}
Other common themes in the research is regular group meetings, personalized feedback, nutritional education. 





\section{Summary}In this section, I reviewed relevant background information for this dissertation, including behavior change theories, traditional approaches specifically for supporting nutrition behavior change, and the important role of  self monitoring. I provided some overviews of how self-monitoring has been studied both from a technology development perspective, and how nutritionists evaluate self-monitoring of dietary intake from a utility perspective. I also provided a short overview of projects related to those discussed in this dissertation.
