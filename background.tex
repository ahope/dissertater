\chapter{Background}
\label{cha:background}
This chapter covers background material that informs this dissertation. This primarily consists of the psychological and cognitive theories of behavior, learning and change that relate to self-monitoring. These theories inform the design of interventions to change behavior, either in general or specifically for nutrition behaviors. This background will highlight the role and importance of self-monitoring as a tool for nutrition behavior change. Included in this background is persuasive technology, which uses the aforementioned theories to define strategies and tactics of employing technology to nudge behavior. 

 This chapter will introduce the various theories and related concepts that impact the design and evaluation of the self-monitoring tools presented in this dissertation. 

\section{Introduction}
This dissertation presents a theory-driven food diary design. 

Over the years, self-monitoring tools have been used to modify behavior, but in regards to the use of self-monitoring tools for changing nutrition behaviors, we don't really know how or why they work or don't work, or what features are helpful or not helpful. 

For this dissertation, it's important to understand the theoretical basis of the role that self-monitoring tools play in the greater behavior change process. The reader needs to understand the underlying theories. 

In this chapter, I present a model of individual behavior, which focuses on how we believe individual, internal behavior works. We then address how the individual relates to the greater environment and community. I then introduce some constructs that cut across all of these theories. Finally, I describe some tools and approaches to tools that are used to shape behavior by supporting or being informed by the theories. 


\section{Theories of Behavior}
In this section, I review some relevant theories in regards to behavior change. 

\subsection{Intent to change: Theory of Planned Behavior} 
The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) is a model of individual behavior that assumes a person is a rational actor. It builds off the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). TRA states that a person's behavior is determined by behavioral intention. Behavioral intention depends on attitude (individual beliefs about a behavior) and a subjective norm. The subjective norm stems from the individual's normative beliefs, which is defined as whether influential parties approve or disapprove of the behavior in question. 

This is embodied in the real world by:
* Calculating attitude:
	* measuring likelihood that a target behavior will result in a specific outcome. 
	* Evaluating the [attractiveness] of an outcome (whether the outcome is good or bad). 
	* combine the above two items for each potential outcome of a behavior. 
	* combine all the combinations to determine the individual's attitude toward that change. 
* Calculating normative beliefs:
	* For each identified referent (parent, doctor, peer...):
		* The individual rates how the referent feels about the individual performing the target behavior. 
		* The individual rates how much influence that referent has on their behavior (ie, ``I agree that I want to do what my doctor thinks I should do''). 
		* combine the above two items. 
	* Combine the results for each referent. 

The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) extends TRA by including a component of volitional control. Volitional control captures the individual's ability to exercise control over the target behavior. Volitional control is included in the model by perceived behavioral control. If the individual perceives a great amount of behavioral control, then motivation (as characterized by TRA) drives the individual's performance of the target behavior. If the individual perceives little control over their ability to execute the target behavior, the individual expends less effort in pursuit of the target behavior. Perceived control depends on control beliefs and perceived power of each belief. 

\subsection{Reframing change: Cognitive-Behavioral Theory}

Cognitive-Behavioral Training (CBT) teaches people how to change the way they think about their nutrition behaviors to support them in the change. 

\subsection{Context-aware change: Social Cognitive Theory}
Social Cognitive Theory \citep{bandura_health_2004, bandura_self-efficacy:_1977} is based on reciprocal determinism: a person’s behavior, environment and inner qualities continuously interact. This theory includes constructs that address how people learn, how environments impact behavior, and how people regulate their own behavior. 

One of the key contributions of SCT is observational learning: the belief that people can learn by observing others learning and experiencing vicarious reinforcement. This is in contrast to the more traditional belief of operant learning, which dictates that an individual needs to execute a behavior and be directly rewarded for it in order to learn. A factor in using observational learning to change one's behavior is the individual's perception of how similar the observed situation is to their own situation. That is, if Person A observes that Person B engaged in specific behaviors to stop smoking, Person A will believe that applying similar behaviors will have a similar outcome if Person A observes that Person B has similarities in key personal and environmental factors. Observational learning is particularly relevant when considering health behaviors because the reward or reinforcement for executing healthy behaviors is frequently not immediate, but emerges over time. 

The role of environment and perception of environment are also important SCT. Environment includes all factors external to the individual, including interpersonal relationships. When considering nutrition behaviors, environment may dictate what foods are available to an individual, for example due to seasonal availability or what is available to purchase at a grocery store or cafeteria. The social environment may dictate what foods are appealing to choose or the ability to request specific foods (e.g., whether a child can ask an adult for special foods). 

Self-efficacy is the belief in one’s abilities to overcome specific challenges associated with a target behavior. Self-efficacy derives from the earlier mentioned interaction among the individual's behavior, the environment, and the individual's inner qualities. When the individual executes an action within the environment, the result either meets expectations or not. If the individual's self-efficacy was high around this particular action, an unanticipated result may not have much of an impact. However, if the individual's self-efficacy was low, an unanticipated result could substantially negatively impact the individual's belief around that behavior, environment and ability to navigate it. 

Self-efficacy is traditionally measured by self-report. To develop self-efficacy measurements for a particular domain, researchers use open-ended approaches to identify common challenges and barriers to the problem. They then develop a series of statements of the form ``How confident are you that you can [achieve goal] even though [challenge]?'' with a 4-unit response scale ranging from ``Cannot do it'' to ``Highly certain can do''. An example of a statement is ``How confident are you that you can stick to a healthy eating plan after a long, tiring day at work?''. Research shows self-efficacy measures based on self-report indicate adherence to strategies to change behavior \citep{nothwehr_self-efficacy_2008}. While short-term studies cannot prove behavior change, self-efficacy measures provides valuable feedback about whether an intervention is supporting adherence to behavior change strategies, and indicate whether participants complete the study with an intention to continue.


\section{Cross-cutting Constructs}

\subsection{The process of change: Transtheoretical Model}
The transtheoretical model (TTM) \citep{prochaska_transtheoretical_1997} reflects that people are in varying stages of change in relation to a given behavior. It arises from study of a theoretical intervention therapies, such as psychoanalysis, gestalt, and cognitive therapies. Across all these theories, Prochaska et al determined that intervention therapies had no time construct. He interviewed people who were not familiar with intervention therapies but had successfully changed a key behavior. He found that change was a process that unfolded over time. This process could be broken into stages, each with certain characteristics. Further, constructs from some theories were applicable in some stages of change, while a seemingly contradictory theoretical construct was appropriate for a different stage of change. A key finding from the TTM inquiry is that no single theory can fully describe and account for the complexities of behavior change. 

The stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. A person in the stage of precontemplation does not intend to take action around the target behavior within the next six months. That person moves to contemplation when they intend to take action within the next six mohts, and then into preparation when they intend to take action within thirty days. People in the preparation stage usually have taken some steps toward the change. Action reflects that the person has engaged in the new behavior for less than six month. Finally, maintenance is having continued the new behavior for more than six months. 

Two constructs impact progression from one stage to the next: decisional balance and self-efficacy. Decisional balance is a comparison of the benefits of changing to the costs of changing. To move from the preparation to the action stage, the benefits need to increase by one standard deviation, or the costs need to decrease by half a standard deviation. That is, the person needs to either identify many more benefits to changing, or reduce the impact of a few barriers. Self-efficacy is a measure of how confident an individual is about their ability to continue the target behavior in challenging situations. 

Understanding the TTM is important for designing behavior change interventions because different theoretical constructs and processes apply to different stages of change. For individuals in precontemplation, consciousness raising and environmental reevaluation are key processes. These processes focus on strategies that target education of the individual, or changing how they view themselves in relation to the target behavior. In the action stage, processes such as counterconditioning and helping relationships support continuation of the target behavior. Counterconditioning focuses on how to replace unhealthy behaviors with target behaviors. Helping relationships includes building relationships that support the individual in the change. 




\subsection{Motivating change: Goal setting and tending}
Here I talk about Locke and Latham \citep{locke_building_2002} and Consolvo and Landay \citep{consolvo_goal-setting_2009}. Goal theory. How to define goals. How to support progress toward goals. 

Goal setting theory \citep{locke_building_2002} focuses on the characteristics of effective goals, including the process through which they are defined, who is involved in the definition, and how challenging the goals are. Goals can be used to motivate change by directing attention and action toward specific target for performance. When people are given high goals and are able to negotiate the time frame, they work harder to meet those goals. In contrast to exhorting people to ``do their best'', setting and tending goals motivates people to perform better overall. 

There are three mediators to goal performance: goal commitment, feedback, and task complexity. Goal commitment includes both importance and self-efficacy. Importance may be either internally or externally driven. Goals set by an external mediator (e.g. boss, coach) benefit from including the individual in the goal-setting process due to the cognitive engagement: providing an explanation for why the goals are important. Self-efficacy reflects how capable the individual feels about attaining the goal. Increasing self-efficacy can increase commitment to attaining the goal. Feedback is important to allow individuals to track progress toward goal attainment. Feedback allows individuals to modify their approach as necessary. Finally, task complexity is key to the attainment of goals. For challenging tasks, individuals perform better on tasks that focus on a specific learning goal as opposed to a general performance goal. Additionally, breaking a complex, challenging task into appropriate sub-tasks helps people to perform those tasks and successfully achieve the overall complex task.  

When people with high self-efficacy set goals, they set higher or more challenging goals than those with low self-efficacy. They also ``are more committed to assigned goals, find and use better task strategies to attain the goals, and respond more positively to negative feedback than do people with low self-efficacy'' \citep{locke_building_2002}. 



Goal setting theory is consistent with SCT, in that they both incorporate the importance of goals and self-efficacy.

\section{Tools}

\subsection{Motivational Interviewing}
Motivational interviewing (MI) \citep{miller_motivational_2002, Miller2002} is a process practitioners use to identify what areas of change an individual is ready for. It is a technique employing goal setting, feedback mechanisms, and self-monitoring. There are three key elements: collaboration rather than confrontation; evoking ideas rather than imposing ideas; and autonomy rather than authority. In addition are four principles to follow: express empathy, support self-efficacy, roll with resistance, and ``develop discrepancy'' (or identify cognitive dissonance). 

MI has a strong record of impact for many types of behavior change \citep{Rubak2005}. It is particularly effective and well respected in the area of nutrition behavior changes \citep{abraham_taxonomy_2008, michie_effective_2009, greaves_systematic_2011}. 

\subsection{Self-Monitoring}

First, I'll talk about what self-monitoring of dietary intake is, and what is involved. Self-monitoring of dietary intake is the process that an individual uses to keep track of what they eat. The self-monitoring process is impacted by both the tool or instrument used for self-monitoring and the individual doing the self-monitoring. In regards to the individual, the process of self-monitoring involves cognitive processes, and the ability or willingness to continue self-monitoring involves individual goals, motivation, and resources.   The design of the tool impacts the process by clarifying (communicating? reminding?) goals as well as responding to individual motivation and resources. 


Research consistently supports that self-monitoring helps to mediate behavior change. Indeed, \citet{kanfer_self-monitoring:_1970} states ``self-observation is an initial step to self-directed behavior change''. Much research in this area falls outside the scope of this chapter, but in the domain of weight-loss, people who adhere to consistent self-monitoring of dietary intake lose more weight and have better indicators of related behaviors. Burke et al and the PREFER trial. WHI. \citep{greaves_systematic_2011}

It is unclear how self-monitoring impacts behavior change, or what mediates the process of self-monitoring. This is primarily due to limitations in the ability to evaluate the self-monitoring process. \citep{Baranowski1994, kanfer_self-monitoring:_1970, burke_self-monitoring_2005, glanz_improving_2006}. 

Later in this chapter I further explore how electronic self-monitoring tools for dietary intake are evaluated. 

\subsection{Self-Monitoring for Health}
Self-monitoring has been key to supporting lifestyle behavior changes necessary for treating cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and renal disease. 

Electronic self-monitoring has advantages over pencil and paper self-monitoring. 

Certain lifestyle behaviors can help to prevent disease as well as treat it. 

Since many of the behavior changes relate to nutrition and dietary intake, much research focuses on this. However, nutrition literature demonstrates that brief monitoring of the behaviors can still be effective. The technology domain has not put much emphasis on investigating brief monitoring instruments. 

Self-monitoring can help people make the behavior changes that prevent disease. 

The cognitive processes involved in the recall of food have been described in children as \citep{Baranowski1994}:
·    Attention
·    Perception
·    Organisation
·    Retention
·    Retrieval
·    Response formulation
People need to attend to the food that they are eating, at the time they eat it, in order to perceive it. The food information then needs to be organized and stored for retention. Then, the food information needs to be retrieved, and formulated into a response or action (e.g. creating a record). 

\subsection{Technology and Behavior Change (Persuasive Technology)}
In this section, talk about the body of work that has looked at how to use technology to support behavior change. Persuasive technology \citep{Fogg2002} and theory-driven technology \citep{consolvo_theory-driven_2009}. 

\section{Approaches to Changing Nutrition Behaviors}
Here I describe some standard approaches and theories nutritionists use to inform behaviors change to provide as background for reference later in this dissertation. It is not an exhaustive list. 




\subsection{Other techniques}
Other common themes in the research is regular group meetings, personalized feedback, nutritional education. 





\section{Summary}In this section, I reviewed relevant background information for this dissertation, including behavior change theories, traditional approaches specifically for supporting nutrition behavior change, and the important role of  self monitoring. I provided some overviews of how self-monitoring has been studied both from a technology development perspective, and how nutritionists evaluate self-monitoring of dietary intake from a utility perspective. I also provided a short overview of projects related to those discussed in this dissertation.
