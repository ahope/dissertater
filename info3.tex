\chapter{The Thesis Unformatted}
 
This chapter describes the uwthesis class (\texttt{uwthesis.cls},
version dated 2011/06/27)
in detail 
and shows how it was used to format the thesis.
A working knowledge of Lamport's \LaTeX\ manual\cite{Lbook} is assumed.
 
\section{The Control File}
 
The source to this sample thesis is contained in a single file
only because ease of distribution was a concern.
You should not do this.  Your task will be much easier if you
break your thesis into several files:  a file for the preliminary pages,
a file for each chapter,  one for the glossary, and one for each
appendix.  Then use a control file to tie them all together.
This way you can edit and format parts of your thesis much more
efficiently.
 
Figure~\ref{control-file} shows a control file that
might have produced this thesis.
It sets the document style, with options and parameters,
and formats the various parts of the thesis---%
but contains no text of its own.

   This file is the input to \LaTeX\ that will produce a
   thesis.  It contains no text, only commands which
   direct the formatting of the thesis.
   This is also an example of a `facing page' caption.  It is guaranteed
   to appear on a lefthand page, facing the figure contents on the right.

    \include{appxb}
 
    \include{vita} 
    \end{document}
  \end{verbatim}
 \end{fullpage}
\end{figure}
 
The first section, from the \verb"\documentclass" to
the \verb"\begin\{document\}", defines the document class and options.
This thesis has specified two-sided formatting, which is now
allowed by the Graduate School.  Two sided printing is now
actually \LaTeX's default.  If you want one sided printing
you must specify \verb"oneside".
This sample also specified a font size
of 11 points. 
Possible font size options are: \verb"10pt", \verb"11pt", and \verb"12pt".
Default is 12 points, which is the preference
of the Graduate School. If you choose a smaller size be sure to
check with the Graduate School for acceptability.  The smaller fonts
can produce very small sub and superscripts.

Include most additional formatting packages with \verb"\usepackage",
as describe by Lamport\cite{Lbook}.  The one exception to this
rule is the \verb"natbib" package.  Include it with the \verb"natbib"
document option.
 
Use the \verb"\includeonly" command to format only a part of your
thesis.  See Lamport\cite[sec. 4.4]{Lbook} for usage and limitations.

 
\section{The Text Pages}
 
A chapter is a major division of the thesis.  Each chapter begins
on a new page and has a Table of Contents entry.
 
\subsection{Chapters, Sections, Subsections, and Appendices}
 
 
Within the chapter title use a \verb"\\" control sequence to separate lines
in the printed title (recall Figure \ref{start-2}.).
The \verb"\\" does not affect the Table of Contents entry.
 
Format appendices just like chapters.
The control sequence \verb"\appendix" instructs \LaTeX\ to
begin using the term `Appendix' rather than `Chapter'.
 
 
Sections and subsections of a chapter are specified
by  \verb"\section" and \verb"\subsection", respectively.
In this thesis chapter and section
titles are written to the table of contents.
Consult Lamport\cite[pg. 176]{Lbook} to see which
subdivisions of the thesis can be written to the table of contents.
The \verb"\\" control sequence is not permitted in section and
subsection titles.
 
 
\subsection{Footnotes}
 
\label{footnotes}
 Footnotes format as described in the \LaTeX\ book.  You can also
 ask for end-of-chapter or end-of-thesis notes.
 The thesis class will automatically set these up if
 you ask for the document class option \texttt{chapternotes}
 or \texttt{endnotes}.  
 
If selected, chapternotes will print automatically.  If you choose
endnotes however you must explicitly indicate when to print the notes 
with the command \verb"\printendnotes".  See the style guide for
suitable endnote placement.  

\subsection{Figures and Tables}
Standard \LaTeX\ figures and tables, see Lamport\cite[sec.~C.9]{Lbook},
normally provide the most convenient means to position the figure.
Full page floats and facing captions are exceptions to this rule.

If you want a figure or table to occupy a full page enclose the
contents in a \texttt{fullpage} environment.  
See figures~\ref{facing-caption}.

Facing page captions are described
in the Style Manual\cite{SP}.  They have different meanings
depending on whether you are using
the one-side or two-side thesis style.


If you are using the two-side style,
facing captions
are full page captions for full page figures or tables
and must face the illustration to which they refer.
You must explicitly format both pages. 
The caption part must appear on an even page
(left side) and the figure or table must
come on the following odd page (right side).
Enclose the float contents for the caption 
in a \texttt{leftfullpage} environment,
and enclose the float contents for the figure or table 
in a \texttt{fullpage} environment.
Figure~\ref{control-file}, for example,
required a full page so its caption (on a facing caption page)
would have been formatted as shown in figure~\ref{facing-caption}a.
The first page (left side) contains the caption. The second page
(right side) could be left blank.  A picture or graph might be pasted onto
this space.


\begin{figure}[t]
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{figure}[p]% the left side caption
       \begin{leftfullpage}
         \caption{ . . . }
       \end{leftfullpage}
     \end{figure}
     \begin{figure}[p]% the right side space
       \begin{fullpage}
          . . .
          ( note.. no caption here )
       \end{fullpage}
     \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\caption(a){This text would create a
  double page figure in the two-side style.}
\label{facing-caption}
\end{figure}
 
\begin{figure}[t]
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{figure}[p]
        \begin{leftfullpage}
           \caption{ . . . }
        \end{leftfullpage}
     \end{figure}
     \begin{figure}[p]% the right side space
       \begin{xtrafullpage}
          . . .
          ( note.. no caption here )
       \end{xtrafullpage}
     \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\caption(b)[Generating a facing caption page]{This text would create a
  facing caption page with the accompaning figure in the one-side style.}
\end{figure}
 
If instead you are using the one-side style,
facing caption pages are still
captions for full page figures or tables
that appear on the left-hand page (facing the illustration on the
right-hand page).  
However, the page number and binding offset are reversed
from their normal positions.
Format these captions by enclosing the float contents
in a \texttt{leftfullpage} environment.
Because you are printing on only one side of each sheet, you must manually
turn over this caption sheet. 
You then have the choice of inserting a preprinted illustration or
formatting one to print with the thesis. 
In either case no page number should appear
on the illustration page, nor should the page number increment. 
Enclose your figure's text
in an \texttt{xtrafullpage} environment, which will cause the
page numbers to come out right.  
You can, of course, leave out the illustration and insert a preprinted
copy later. 
Figure~\ref{facing-caption}b shows how to format a facing caption page
in the one-side style. Note that, in this case, the illustration
was also printed.

In the two-side style the \texttt{xtrafullpage} environment acts just like the
\texttt{fullpage} environment.  It does not produce a numberless page.


 
\subsection{Horizontal Figures and Tables}
Figures and tables may be formatted horizontally
(a.k.a.\ landscape) as long as their captions appear
horizontal also.  \LaTeX\ will format landscape material for you
if a couple of conditions are met.  You have to have a printer
and printer driver that allow rotations and
you have to have a couple of add-on \LaTeX\ packages.  

% Users of PostScript printers and Uniform Access computers 
% at the University of Washington will conform to both requirements,
% as will users of PC\TeX\ if they use postscript.

Include the \texttt{rotating} package 
\begin{demo}
\\usepackage[figuresright]\{rotating\}
\end{demo}
and read the documentation that comes with the package. 

Figure~\ref{sideways} is an example of how a landscape
table might be formatted. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
     \begin{sidewaystable}
         ...
         \caption{ . . . }
     \end{sidewaystable}
\end{verbatim}
\caption[Generating a landscape table]{This text would create a
  landscape table with caption.}
\label{sideways}
\end{figure}
 


\subsection{Figure and Table Captions}
Most captions are formatted with the \verb"\caption" macro as described 
by Lamport\cite[sec. C.9]{Lbook}. 
The uwthesis class extends this macro to allow
continued figures and tables, and to provide multiple figures and
tables with the same number, e.g., 3.1a, 3.1b, etc.
 
To format the caption for the first part of
a figure or table that cannot fit
onto a single page use the standard form:
\begin{demo}
\\caption[\textit{toc}]\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
To format the caption for the subsequent parts of 
the figure or table 
use this caption:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(-)\{(continued)\}
\end{demo}
It will keep the same number and the text of the caption will be 
{\em(continued)}.

To format the caption for the first part of
a multi-part figure or table
use the format:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(a)[\textit{toc}]\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
The figure or table will be lettered (with `a') as well as numbered.
To format the caption for the subsequent parts of 
the multi-part figure or table
use the format:
\begin{demo}
\\caption(\textit{x})\{\textit{text}\}
\end{demo}
where {\em x} is {\tt b}, {\tt c}, \ldots.
The parts will be lettered (with `b', `c', \ldots).

\section{The Preliminary Pages}
 
These are easy to format only because they are relatively invariant
among theses.  Therefore the difficulties have already been encountered
and overcome by \LaTeX\ and the thesis document classes.

Start with the definitions that describe your thesis.
This sample thesis was printed with the parameters:

\begin{demo}
\\Title\{The Suitability of the \\LaTeX\\ Text Formatter\\\\
   for Thesis Preparation by Technical and\\\\
   Non-technical Degree Candidates\}
\\Author\{Jim Fox\}
\\Program\{UW Information Technology\}
\\Year\{2012\}

\\Chair\{Name of Chairperson\}\{title\}\{Chair's department\}
\\Signature\{First committee member\}
\\Signature\{Next committee member\}
\\Signature\{etc\}

\end{demo}
 
Use two or more \verb"\Chair" lines if you have co-chairs.
 
\subsection{Copyright page}
Print the copyright page with \verb"\copyrightpage".

\subsection{Title page}
Print the title page with \verb"\titlepage".
The title page of this thesis was printed with%
\footnote{Actually, it wasn't.  I added a footnote---something you would not do.}
 
\begin{demo}
\\titlepage
\end{demo}
 
You may change default text on the title page with these
macros.  You will have to redefine \verb"\Degreetext", for instance,
if you're writing a Master's thesis instead of a dissertation.\footnote{If you use these they can
be included with the other information before \\copyrightpage".}

\begin{list}{}{\itemindent\parindent\itemsep0pt
   \def\makelabel#1{\texttt{\char`\\#1}\hfill}}
\item[Degree\char`\{{\it degree name}\char`\}]
   defaults to ``Doctor of Philosophy''
\item[School\char`\{{\it school name}\char`\}] defaults to
``University of Washington''
\item[Degreetext\char`\{{\it degree text}\char`\}] defaults to
``A dissertation submitted \ldots''
\item[textofCommittee\char`\{{\it committee label}\char`\}] defaults to
``Reading Committee:''
\item[textofChair\char`\{{\it chair label}\char`\}] defaults to
``Chair of the Supervisory Committee:''
\end{list}

These definitions must appear \underline{before} the \verb"\titlepage" command.

 
\subsection{Abstract}
Print the
abstract with \verb"\abstract".
It has one argument, which is the text of the abstract.
All the names have already been defined.
The abstract of this thesis was printed with
 
\begin{demo}
\\abstract\{This sample . . . `real' dissertation.\}
\end{demo}
 
 
\subsection{Tables of contents}
Use the standard \LaTeX\ commands to format these items.
 
 
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
Use the \verb"\acknowledgments" macro to format the acknowledgments page.
It has one argument, which is the text of the acknowledgment.
The acknowledgments of this thesis was printed with
 
\begin{demo}
\\acknowledgments\{The author wishes . . . \{\\it il miglior fabbro\}.\\par\}\}
\end{demo}
 
 
\subsection{Dedication}
Use the \verb"\dedication" macro to format the dedication page.
It has one argument, which is the text of the dedication.
 
\subsection{Vita}
Use the \verb"\vita" macro to format the curriculum vitae.
It has one argument, which chronicles your life's accomplishments.

Note that the Vita is not really a preliminary page.
It appears at the end of your thesis, just after the appendices.

%% \section{Customization of the Macros}
%%  
%% Simple customization, including 
%% alteration of default parameters,  changes to dimensions,
%% paragraph indentation, and margins, are not too difficult.
%% You have the choice of modifying the class file ({\tt uwthesis.cls})
%% or loading
%% one or more personal style files to customize your thesis.
%% The latter is usually most convenient, since you do not need
%% to edit the large and complicated class file.
