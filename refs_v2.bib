	abstract = {Self-monitoring has traditionally been done using a paper record, which can be tedious and burdensome. A personal digital assistant {(PDA)} with dietary software can provide an alternative to a paper record. The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or {PDA} for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n=192) was 84\% female and 78\% white, with a mean age of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m(2)) of 34.1. At baseline, the groups did not differ in energy intake, percent calories from fat, and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and percent calories from total fat and saturated fatty acids {(P{\textless}0.001);} no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the {PDA} group significantly increased consumption of fruit {(P=0.02)} and vegetables {(P=0.04)} and decreased consumption of refined grains {(P=0.02).} Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in percent calories from total fat {(P=0.02)}, monounsaturated fatty acids {(P=0.002)}, and trans-fatty acids {(P=0.04).} Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar {(P=0.02)} and added sugar {(P=0.01)} intake in both groups. Our findings suggest that use of a {PDA} for self-monitoring might improve self-awareness of behavior and dietary changes.},

Our research group is working with the easy health diary, a self-help tool for people with type 2 diabetes. The tool is based on smartphones, and its functionality applies to each of the three cornerstones of diabetes management: physical activity, nutrition and healthy blood glucose values. The target user group is typically aged 50 or more, so it is especially important that a self-help tool should have low technical thresholds and a highly usable design. Such tools may also support applications to help the general population meet today's vast health challenges. A prototype has been designed and tested on 32 people: 12 users with type 2 diabetes and 20 individuals without diabetes. All informants had a generally positive reaction to the prototype and the user group was more positive than the reference group. The informants emphasized the importance of making the tool extremely easy to use and integrated with the everyday routines of the users.},

	abstract = {The scientific community has long been interested in the overall quality of diets owing to the fact that it is important for each individual's health through a healthy, varied, and balanced diet. Much research has been conducted on methods used to measure dietary quality. These studies led to the determination of numerous indices, some very simple and some much more complex. Indices that examine diets for several attributes concurrently are able to provide a measure of overall diet quality that is not possible when only single nutrients or food groups are examined. Using these indices, diet quality may be evaluated in relation to nutrient adequacy, compliance with dietary guidelines, or nutrition recommendations, association with risk of chronic diseases, or mortality, and used to assess interventions. However, there are several factors that should be taken into consideration for the design of an index, like the purpose of its use, as well as its simplicity in daily practice. The general purpose of an index is to synthesize a large amount of information into a single useful indicator. The purpose of this review was to present and to critically review the most commonly used dietary indices, and how they reflect various aspects of diet quality. The majority of these indices fail to recognize the various inter-relationships between their components, as well as their accuracy for estimating specific health outcomes. Thus, the development of weighted dietary indices that adequately assess a dietary pattern and its relationship to the burden of a disease is considered essential.},

	abstract = {Background

Portable hand-held information technology offers much promise not only in assessing dietary intake in the real world, but also in providing dietary feedback to individuals. However, stringent research designs have not been employed to examine whether it can be effective in modifying dietary behaviors. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant {[PDA])} for increasing vegetable and whole-grain intake over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults, using a randomized study design.
Methods

Twenty-seven healthy adults aged ≥50 were randomized and completed the 8-week study. Intervention participants received an instructional session and a {PDA} programmed to monitor their vegetable and whole-grain intake levels twice per day and to provide daily individualized feedback, goal-setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate, written nutritional education materials. Dietary intake was assessed via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.
Results

Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in vegetable servings (1.5–2.5 servings/day; p=0.02), as well as a trend toward greater intake of dietary fiber from grains (3.7–4.5 servings/day; p=0.10).
Conclusions

This study's findings provide preliminary evidence that using portable hand-held technology to provide daily individualized feedback on dietary behavior in the real world can increase the dietary intake of healthy food groups.},

	title = {Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change},
	volume = {84},
	abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Belief in one's efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change--whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved.

Subjects also were timed while recording an observed, weighed lunch. Recalled and actual food intakes were compared with estimates recorded by the subjects when using the {PDA.} Paired sample t tests and Pearson's correlations assessed means and measurements of association between {DietMatePro} data compared with the 24-h recall data and observed meal data. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess bias in food recording. Sources of error were quantified by using calories as the unit for comparison. {RESULTS:} There were no significant differences in daily totals for calories and macronutrients between {DietMatePro} data and comparison measurements. Pearson's correlations of associations between {DietMatePro} data and the comparison measurement ranged from 0.505 to 0.797 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 28) for the 24-h recall and from 0.419 to 0.786 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 33) for the observed lunch, depending on the nutrient measured. The largest source of absolute error in caloric estimation was attributable to portion size estimation error (49\%). {CONCLUSIONS:} {DietMatePro}, a {PDA-based} dietary assessment program, provides a method of assessing energy and macronutrient intakes comparable to the 24-h recall in samples lacking dietary restrictions.},

Intervention: Participants (n = 174) were randomized to record usual dietary intake using either {DietMatePro} or a paper food diary for one week to compare concordance with 24-hr recall. At the week 1 visit, participants were individually counseled to follow the diet recommendations of the Ornish Prevention Diet for three weeks and continue monitoring food intake using the assigned method to estimate adherence to the intervention by monitoring condition. Outcome Measures: Spearman correlations between week 1 24-hr recall and the assigned recording method were compared to assess validity. Mean pre-post changes in intake measured by 24-hr recall were compared according to monitoring condition to measure adherence to the Ornish diet. Results: Correlations of energy and nutrient values reported on the food label ranged from 0.41 to 0.71 for the {DietMatePro} condition versus 0.63 to 0.83 for the paper-based diary. Diet adherence was higher among {DietMatePro} (43\%) compared to the paper diary (28\%) group (p = 0.039). {Conclusions/Applications:} {DietMatePro} does not appear to produce more valid data than paper-based approaches. {DietMatePro} may improve adherence to dietary regimens compared to paper-based methods.},

	abstract = {In dietary studies, subjects' estimates of portion size are a major source of error (1). Consumers and patients who are unable to estimate food portions accurately may lack a basis for evaluating or improving their dietary intake because they do not know how much they have eaten. Furthermore, recommendations based on inaccurate information may result in inappropriate changes in intakes of energy or nutrients. Several researchers have reported that training enhanced the accuracy of persons' estimates of food portions (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9). In various studies, subjects have been trained with actual foods (3), (6), (7), (8) and (9), 3-dimensional {(3D)} food models (2), (3), (4), (5), (7) and (8), and 2-dimensional {(2D)} food photographs (2).

When training subjects, {3D} models may be more effective because they are closer in shape and volume to real foods than {2D} photographs. However, Howat et al (2) reported that training with a combination of food models and life-sized food photographs enhanced accuracy more than the use of food models alone. The studies were limited to small groups of 4 to 26 people, with little evaluation of retention of training except at 1 and 4 weeks (5) or 4 months (6). How might training in estimation of food portions be provided in college courses with large enrollments? The purpose of this research was to determine if visually estimating food portions in a display case— a type of training more feasible for a large group—could improve college students' estimates of food portions. Additional purposes were to determine the retention of any training effect and if further exposure to {3D} or {2D} food models could substantially enhance the accuracy of estimates of food portions after viewing the food display.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Excess gestational weight gain {(GWG)} is an important risk factor for long term obesity in women. However, current interventions aimed at preventing excess {GWG} appear to have a limited effect. Several studies have highlighted the importance of linking theory with empirical evidence for producing effective interventions for behaviour change. Theorists have demonstrated that goals can be an important source of human motivation and goal setting has shown promise in promoting diet and physical activity behaviour change within non-pregnant individuals. The use of goal setting as a behaviour change strategy has been systematically evaluated within overweight and obese individuals, yet its use within pregnancy has not yet been systematically explored. {AIM} {OF} {REVIEW:} To explore the use of goal setting within healthy lifestyle interventions for the prevention of excess {GWG.}


{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}

Searches were conducted in seven databases alongside hand searching of relevant journals and citation tracking. Studies were included if interventions used goal setting alongside modification of diet and/or physical activity with an aim to prevent excess {GWG.} The {PRISMA} guidelines were followed and a two-stage methodological approach was used. Stage one focused on systematically evaluating the methodological quality of included interventions. The second stage assessed intervention integrity and the implementation of key goal setting components.


{FINDINGS}

From a total of 839 citations, 54 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among interventions reporting positive results a combination of individualised diet and physical activity goals, self-monitoring and performance feedback indicators were described as active components.


{CONCLUSION}

Interventions based on goal setting appear to be useful for helping women achieve optimal weight gain during pregnancy. However, overweight and obese women may require more theoretically-designed interventions. Further high quality, theoretically-designed interventions are required to determine the most effective and replicable components for optimal {GWG.}},

Attitudes were a summation of beliefs about taste, different health consequences, and costs in time and money. Social influences were measured through the social stimulation respondents expected to get from important others to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables and by asking the subjects about the behaviour of important others. Self-efficacy reflected the respondents» ability to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in various situations. Self-efficacy and attitudes were consistently and significantly associated with consumption of boiled or otherwise heated vegetables, of salads, and of fruit. Furthermore, respondents reporting low consumption of these food groups had lower self-efficacy expectations and less positive attitudes than subjects with relatively high consumption of fruit and vegetables. It is concluded that nutrition education aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable consumption should focus especially on changing attitudes and self efficacy expectations.},

The program needs to appropriately balance the level of detail used with the burden load on respondents and errors associated with categorisation of foods into groups. Various statistical techniques were utilised to aggregate a large number of food items into compositionally and conceptually similar groups. Exploratory statistical analysis, cluster analysis, stepwise regression analysis and association rule analysis were performed. A database containing 433 food groups was created which minimised the level of database error in the resulting data collection. Although some database error was introduced by aggregating food items into groups, the magnitude of the errors was reasonable considering other error sources. These findings are useful when applied to collection of food intake information for an individual's diet history and measurement of energy and macronutrient intake.},

	abstract = {Background: The treatment of obesity, marked by a high rate of recidivism, lacks strategies that sustain the improved lifestyle behaviors that led to the weight loss. Self-monitoring, a behavioral strategy to increase awareness of one's behavior, is the cornerstone of behavioral treatment in weight loss management. However, adherence to self-monitoring is less than ideal. The actual patterns of self-monitoring of eating behaviors in weight loss treatment programs have not been studied previously; if done, these data could provide information on how self-monitoring patterns affect weight loss and if interventions can be developed that address deficits in self-monitoring. Technology now permits an instrumented paper-and-pencil diary to record the real time of individuals' self-monitoring behaviors (invivodata, inc.), thus providing more information about self-reported behaviors. This technology differs from {PDA} based products (ex. e-diary, e-trials, logpad, {PICS)} because, to the user, it is no different from a standard paper-and-pencil diary. Methods: The purposes of this ancillary study are: (1) to describe the electronically recorded patterns of self-monitoring of eating behaviors by weight-loss study participants; (2) compare reported vs. electronically recorded self-monitoring; and (3) examine the relationship between the electronically validated adherence to self-monitoring goals and success in weight loss in a sub-sample of participants in the {PREFER} study. This paper describes the design, methods and preliminary 6-month results. Results: Preliminary results reveal that participants frequently report recording their eating behavior during times when the binder was not opened. Two examples of data are shown that demonstrate the lack of concordance between the self-reported and the electronically recorded data. Conclusions: These unobtrusively collected electronic data can lead to the development of strategies that can promote improved adherence to self-monitoring. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Constant comparative and matrix analysis procedures were used to analyze interview data; the qualitative results were then interfaced with descriptive numerical data on individuals' adherence to self-monitoring and weight loss. Three categories of self-monitoring experience were identified: (a) well-disciplined - those who had high adherence to self-monitoring, high weight loss, and a "can do" positive approach, (b) missing the connection - those who had moderate adherence, moderate- to low weight loss, and an "it's an assignment" approach, without integrating self-monitoring into everyday life, and (c) diminished support - those who had poor adherence, poor weight control, and were adversely affected by coexisting negative factors. Given the variations in how individuals integrated the process of self-monitoring, we need to consider individualizing self-monitoring strategies to improve adherence. © 2009 The Author(s).},

Our study aimed to investigate whether using a personal digital assistant {(PDA)} with dietary and exercise software, with and without a feedback message, compared to using a paper diary/record {(PR)}, results in greater weight loss and improved self-monitoring adherence. Healthy adults {(N} = 210) with a mean {BMI} of 34.01 kg/m(2) were randomized to one of three self-monitoring approaches: {PR} (n = 72), {PDA} with self-monitoring software (n = 68), or {PDA} with self-monitoring software and daily feedback messages {(PDA+FB}, n = 70). All participants received standard behavioral treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and change in body weight, waist circumference, and diet were assessed at 6 months; retention was 91\%. All participants had a significant weight loss {(P} {\textless} 0.01) but weight loss did not differ among groups. A higher proportion of {PDA+FB} participants (63\%) achieved ≥ 5\% weight loss in comparison to the {PR} group (46\%) {(P} {\textless} 0.05) and {PDA} group (49\%) {(P} = 0.09). Median percent self-monitoring adherence over the 6 months was higher in the {PDA} groups {(PDA} 80\%; {PDA+FB} 90\%) than in the {PR} group (55\%) {(P} {\textless} 0.01).

	abstract = {Self-monitoring is the centerpiece of behavioral weight loss intervention programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies. Of the 22 studies identified, 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring, one on self-monitoring exercise, and six on self-weighing. A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring; the paper diary was used most often. Adherence to self-monitoring was reported most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency of log-ins or reported weights. The use of technology, which included the Internet, personal digital assistants, and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies. Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss. A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found; however, the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations. The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report. In all but two studies, the samples were predominantly white and women. This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations, for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring, and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes.},

We compared electronically documented self-monitoring data, showing when and how often {IPDs} were used, with self-reported data, then compared the electronically validated adherence and weight loss. Self-reported previous termdiarynext term usage exceeded {IPD-documented} usage while the electronic data demonstrated a significant decline in self-monitoring over time. previous {termDiarynext} term recording often was not timely. Percentage weight lost correlated significantly with frequency of {IPD} use (p = .001) and the number of previous termdiarynext term entries made within 15 min of opening the {IPD} (p = .002). This is the first study to document patterns of self-monitoring among participants in a weight-loss program, which demonstrated that individuals may falsify the times and frequency of self-monitoring. Furthermore, our results showed that adherence to self-monitoring and the timeliness of recording significantly correlate with improved weight loss.},

Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

In this paper, a new framework, {3D/2D} model-to-image registration, is presented for estimating food volume from a single-view {2D} image containing a reference object (i.e., a circular dining plate). First, the food is segmented from the background image based on Otsu's thresholding and morphological operations. Next, the food volume is obtained from a user-selected, {3D} shape model. The position, orientation and scale of the model are optimized by a model-to-image registration process. Then, the circular plate in the image is fitted and its spatial information is used as constraints for solving the registration problem. Our method takes the global contour information of the shape model into account to obtain a reliable food volume estimate. Experimental results using regularly shaped test objects and realistically shaped food models with known volumes both demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

A camera and accelerometer sensors in the phone are used to build a vision/motion-based water intake tracker to detect the amount and regularity of water consumed by the user. Additionally, the phone includes hydration games in which natural drinking actions are used as game input. Two hydration games are developed: a single-user {TreeGame} with automated computer reminders and a multi-user {ForestGame} with computer-mediated social reminders from members of the group playing the game. Results from 7-week user study with 16 test subjects suggest that both hydration games are effective for encouraging adequate and regular water intake by users. Additionally, results of this study suggest that adding social reminders to the hydration game is more effective than system reminders alone.},

	abstract = {The cost of health care in the United States has been increasing at an annual rate of 9.8\%, faster than the cost of living, since 1970. This is due to many factors, the most significant being preventable and manageable chronic conditions and diseases, known as comorbidities. These comorbidities are associated with individuals who classify as being overweight or obese, representing 68\% of the United States population. This creates a strain on the health care system and the economy. Decreasing the number of overweight or obese individuals is necessary to reduce the prevalence of weight-related comorbidities. This can be accomplished through establishing and maintaining the proper energy balance between caloric intake and physical activity. The government leads many efforts to educate individuals on the importance of incorporating nutrition and physical activity. Since limited budgets for encouraging participation exist, a need exists for a system designed to assist policy makers in determining which age cohorts, or groups, given a level of adherence to recommendations, would result in the most benefit to stakeholders. An analysis was conducted to determine which 10-year age cohort(s) should be targeted for health promotion in efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals. Each age cohort's participation and predicted weight loss was simulated using a validated weight prediction model. Weight loss resulted from partial cohort adherence to nutritional and physical activity recommendations. Design Alternatives were evaluated on effectiveness, determined by weight loss The analysis showed that if 30, 60, or 90 percent of a given cohort adhered to government recommendations, the 60-year age cohorts' outcome would result in the greatest benefit for the smallest cost. The remaining alternatives were ranked based on their cost benefit. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine if the results were sensitive to changes of the importance of the b- - enefit measures. The results demonstrated that the 60-year age cohort was the best alternative in all cases.},

To measure diet of undergraduate students, a new online 121-item Food Recall Checklist {(FoRC)} was designed as an alternative to a non-weighed record (food diary). This article reports the comparison between the new dietary assessment method {(FoRC)} and the food diary as a measure of energy {(kJ)}, fat (g), Non-Starch Polysaccharide {(NSP)} (g), fruit and vegetables (g), breakfast cereal (g) and bread (g) and alcohol (units) intake. Methods: Fifty-three students at the University of Aberdeen completed four days of {FoRC} then four days food diary. Median agreement and correlation between the two methods was assessed for foods and nutrients using the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Agreement between {FoRC} and food diary was assessed using the Bland-Altman method. Results: The mean time taken to complete {FoRC} for one day was 7.4 minutes. Intakes of fat ( g and \% food energy), {NSP} and bread were similar between {FoRC} and the food diary. Median energy intake was 8185 {kJ} in the food diary and 8007 {kJ} in {FoRC.} However, {FoRC} recorded significantly lower intakes of energy and alcohol and significantly higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and breakfast cereal compared with the food diary. There was considerable variation in agreement between methods at the individual level. For all variables except alcohol and percentage energy from fat, correlation co-efficients were statistically significant and greater than 0.5. Conclusion: At the group level, four days of {FoRC} showed good median agreement with the food diary and there was high correlation between methods for most foods and nutrients. This suggests that this novel method of assessing diet can provide a useful alternative for assessing group mean intakes but that individual intakes may need to be interpreted with care.},

This article discusses how we have adapted and applied traditional methods from psychology and human-computer interaction, such as Wizard of Oz and Experience Sampling, to be more amenable to the in situ evaluations of ubiquitous computing applications, particularly in the early stages of design. The way that ubiquitous computing technologies can facilitate the in situ collection of self-report data is also discussed. Although the focus is on ubiquitous computing applications and tools for their assessment, it is believed that the in situ evaluation tools that are proposed will be generally useful for field trials of other technology, applications, or formative studies that are concerned with collecting data in situ.},

Successful dietary behavior change programs target 1 or more of the personal, behavioral, or environmental factors that influence the behavior of interest and apply theory-based strategies to influence or change those factors. Goal setting is a strategy that is frequently used to help people change. A 4-step goal-setting process has been identified: recognizing a need for change; establishing a goal; adopting a goal-directed activity and self-monitoring it; and self-rewarding goal attainment. The applications of goal setting in dietary interventions for adults and children are reviewed here. Because interventions using goal setting appear to promote dietary change, dietitians should consider incorporating the goal-setting strategies to enhance the behavior change process in nutrition education programs.

Two studies reported that electronic collection leads to a substantial reduction in time used for data handling. Five studies reported that the {PDA} method results in better compliance, whereas one study reported the opposite. All three articles reporting on data accuracy indicated that there are fewer errors in the {PDA} records. Four articles scrutinized subject preference, and the {PDA} method came out favorably in all four. {CONCLUSION:} The {PDA} method seems to perform better than {P\&P} in most of the selected outcomes.

For measurement of real-world intake, the diet-previous termdiarynext term technique is imperfect and tends to underestimate actual intakes but it appears to be sensitive, can detect subtle influences on eating behavior, and produces reliable and valid measures. Research studies in the real world show the multivariate richness of the natural environment, which allows investigation of the complexities of intake regulation, and even causation can be investigated. Real-world research can overcome some of the weaknesses of laboratory studies, where constraints on eating are often removed or missing, facilitatory influences on eating are often controlled or eliminated, the importance of variables can be overestimated, and important influences can be missed because of the short durations of the studies. Real-world studies have shown a wide array of physiologic, psychological, and social variables that can have potent and immediate effects on intake. Compensatory mechanisms, including some that operate with a 2- to 3-d delay, adjust for prior excesses. Heredity affects all aspect of previous termfoodnext term-intake regulation, from the determination of body size to the subtleties of the individual preferences and social proclivities and the extent to which environmental factors affect the individual. Hence, real-world research teaches valuable lessons, and much more is needed to complement laboratory studies.},

Satisfaction with the self-management guide was assessed at the end of the study. {RESULTS:} We enrolled 250 patients across three sites and 229 patients completed the study. Most patients chose to set goals in diet and exercise domains. 93\% of patients achieved at least one behavioral goal during the study and 73\% achieved at least two behavioral goals. Many patients exhibited problem solving behavior to achieve their goals. We found no significant differences in reported achievement of behavior goals by literacy or language.

Also, only 32.6\% of adults reportedly consume fruit two or more times per day and 27.2\% eat vegetables three or more times per day (7). To address this public health crisis, there is an urgent need to elucidate key processes underlying healthful lifestyle decisions and develop strategies to promote healthful eating and physical activity.

	abstract = {The obesity epidemic is one of the most rapidly evolving public health problems of our day. At present, 2/3 of American adults and 1/6 of American children and adolescents are considered either overweight or obese. Public health concern about obesity is high and reflects documented increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, many forms of cancer, gallbladder disease, and osteoarthritis, and increased mortality from these ailments, especially among the most obese. Innovative engineering technologies are needed to address a large range of problems in energy balance, intake, and expenditure that are associated with the obesity epidemic. Excess adipose tissue, representing fat storage, ultimately derives from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Novel sensors, devices, imaging technologies, nanotechnology, biomaterials, and other approaches need to be developed and evaluated through multidisciplinary collaborations between engineers, physical scientists, and scientists with expertise in obesity and nutrition. The goal is to encourage research to develop useful technologies and tools to facilitate research and eventually to support therapeutic advances and behavioral change. Furthermore, the possibility of re-engineering the "built environment" to encourage higher levels of physical activity has been suggested as another promising and important approach to which engineers can contribute (see http://www.obesityresearch.nih.gov).},

Food intake assessment is important for obesity management, which has shown significant impacts in public healthcare. Conventional dietary record based food intake assessment methods exhibit insufficient popularity due to their low accuracy and high dependence on human interactions. Image based food recognition appears recently. But it is still under development and far away from field applications. This paper presents {DietCam}, a camera phone based application to evaluate food intakes automatically from multiple perspectives. Food recognition from images is afflicted currently with a low recognition accuracy caused by the uncertainties of food appearances. The deformable nature of food items together with the complex background environment makes the problem even harder. {DietCam} separates every food item through evaluating the best perspective and recognize each of them from multiple images with a probabilistic method. The recognition accuracy is increased through an enhanced joint distribution from every viewpoint. A prototype of {DietCam} has been implemented on {iPhone.} In the field experiments, it shows an accuracy of 84\% for regular shape food items.},

	abstract = {Excess bodyweight is a major public health concern. However, few worldwide comparative analyses of long-term trends of body-mass index {(BMI)} have been done, and none have used recent national health examination surveys. We estimated worldwide trends in population mean {BMI.} We estimated trends and their uncertainties of mean {BMI} for adults 20 years and older in 199 countries and territories. We obtained data from published and unpublished health examination surveys and epidemiological studies (960 country-years and 9·1 million participants). For each sex, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate mean {BMI} by age, country, and year, accounting for whether a study was nationally representative. Between 1980 and 2008, mean {BMI} worldwide increased by 0·4 kg/m
                        2 per decade (95 uncertainty interval 0·2-0·6, posterior probability of being a true increase \&gt;0·999) for men and 0·5 kg/m
                        2 per decade (0·3-0·7, posterior probability \&gt;0·999) for women. National {BMI} change for women ranged from non-significant decreases in 19 countries to increases of more than 2·0 kg/m
                        2 per decade (posterior probabilities \&gt;0·99) in nine countries in Oceania. Male {BMI} increased in all but eight countries, by more than 2 kg/m
                        2 per decade in Nauru and Cook Islands (posterior probabilities \&gt;0·999). Male and female {BMIs} in 2008 were highest in some Oceania countries, reaching 33·9 kg/m
                        2 (32·8-35·0) for men and 35·0 kg/m
                        2 (33·6-36·3) for women in Nauru. Female {BMI} was lowest in Bangladesh (20·5 kg/m
                        2, 19·8-21·3) and male {BMI} in Democratic Republic of the Congo 19·9 kg/m
                        2 (18·2-21·5), with {BMI} less than 21·5 kg/m
                        2 for both sexes in a few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and east, south, and southeast Asia. The {USA} had the highest {BMI} of high-income countries. In 2008, an estimated 1·46 billion adults (1·41-1·51 billion) worldwide had {BMI} of 25 kg/m
                        2 or greater, of these 205 million men (193-217 million) and 297 million women (280-315 million) were obese. Globally, mean {BMI} has increased since 1980. The trends since 1980, and mean population {BMI} in 2008, varied substantially between nations. Interventions and policies that can curb or reverse the increase, and mitigate the health effects of high {BMI} by targeting its metabolic mediators, are needed in most countries.

	abstract = {The National Diet and Nutrition Survey {(NDNS)} gathers information on the dietary habits and nutritional status of the {UK} population aged 1.5 years upward. Mixed dishes, being a mixture of components with varying proportions, prove problematic for categorising and reporting consumption--unlike basic foods, which can be classified into specific food groups relatively easily. For both purchased and homemade mixed dishes, it is advantageous to have a consistent method for assigning dishes to appropriate food groups, while retaining continuity with previous {NDNS} surveys to enable investigation of trends over time. Historically two main methods have been used to classify mixed dishes in the {NDNS} databank: either grouping by meat or fish content, or grouping by the main food component. Neither method is entirely satisfactory. In this study, selected foods were tabulated by both methods to determine which approach should be used in future work. Neither method proved entirely satisfactory alone, and in order to maintain consistency and continuity for the main survey of the new {NDNS} rolling programme, it was decided to take into account elements from both methods and to place comparable recipes together in the same food groups. A varied approach encompassing food names, proportions of ingredients and case-by-case judgement is the most appropriate way to classify mixed food dishes in a nutrient databank.},

This paper reviews the current research examining mobile telephone short-message service {(SMS)} for delivering health behavior change interventions via text messages. This service has wide Population reach, can be individually tailored, and allows instant delivery with asynchronous receipt, suggesting potential as a delivery channel for health behavior interventions. Evidence qcquisition: An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. Studies were included in the review if they (1) evaluated an intervention delivered primarily via {SMS}, (2) assessed change in health behavior using pre-post assessment, and (3) were published in English in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Evidence synthesis: Of 33 studies identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and ten focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes self-management). Positive behavior change outcomes were observed in 13 of the 14 reviewed studies. Intervention initiation (researcher or participant), {SMS} dialogue initiation, tailoring of {SMS} content, and interactivity were found to be important features of {SMS-delivered} interventions. Methodologic issues with current {SMS} research were also identified. Conclusions: This review suggests that {SMS-delivered} interventions have positive short-term behavioral outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate interventions for preventive health behaviors that incorporate features found to affect behavioral outcomes and participant acceptance. The quality of studies in this emerging field of research needs to improve to allow the full potential of this medium to be explored.},

We developed and tested a real-time diet-monitoring and feedback system using hand-held computers.

The process and outcomes were evaluated using real-time food records collected through the {PDAs;} surveys; and self-reported food frequency questionnaires. {RESULTS:} Participants significantly increased self-monitoring, improved their attitudes toward self-monitoring, and met their dietary goals more often. Reported total fat intake and percent energy from fat decreased significantly. There was a modest decrease in mean caloric intake. {DISCUSSION:} The pilot study findings support the largely untapped potential of hand-held computers for improving diet monitoring and diet adherence, particularly within a clinical trial.},

An interagency working group based the {HEI-2005} on the food patterns found in {MyPyramid.} Diets that meet the least restrictive of the food-group recommendations, expressed on a per 1,000 calorie basis, receive maximum scores for the nine adequacy components of the index: total fruit (5 points), whole fruit (5 points), total vegetables (5 points), dark green and orange vegetables and legumes (5 points), total grains (5 points), whole grains (5 points), milk (10 points), meat and beans (10 points), and oils (10 points). Lesser amounts are prorated linearly. Population probability densities were examined when setting the standards for minimum and maximum scores for the three moderation components: saturated fat (10 points), sodium (10 points), and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages (ie, beer, wine, and distilled spirits), and added sugars (20 points). Calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars is a proxy for the discretionary calorie allowance. The 2005 Dietary Guideline for saturated fat and the Adequate Intake and Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium, expressed per 1,000 calories, were used when setting the standards for those components. Intakes between the maximum and minimum standards are prorated. The {HEI-2005} is a measure of diet quality as described by the key diet-related recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines. It has a variety of potential uses, including monitoring the diet quality of the {US} population and subpopulations, evaluation of interventions, and research.},

The Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)}, a measure of diet quality as specified by federal dietary guidance, was revised to conform to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. The {HEI} has several components, the scores of which are {totaled.Objective}
The validity and reliability of the {HEI-2005} were {evaluated.Design}
Validity was assessed by answering four questions: Does the {HEI-2005} 1) give maximum scores to menus developed by experts; 2) distinguish between groups with known differences in diet quality--smokers and nonsmokers; 3) measure diet quality independently of energy intake, a proxy for diet quantity; and 4) have more than one underlying dimension? The relevant type of reliability, internal consistency, was also {assessed.Subjects}
Twenty-four-hour recalls from 8,650 participants, aged 2 years and older, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002 were analyzed to answer questions 2 to 4. Results were weighted to consider sample design and {nonresponse.Statistical} analyses
T tests determined differences in scores between smokers and nonsmokers. Pearson correlation coefficients determined the relationship between energy intake and scores. Principal components analysis determined the number of factors that comprise the {HEI-2005.} Cronbach's coefficient [alpha] tested internal {consistency.Results}
{HEI-2005} scores are at or very near the maximum levels for all sets of exemplary menus with one exception; the Harvard menus scored low on the milk component because these menus intentionally include only small amounts of milk products. Nine of 12 component scores were lower for smokers than nonsmokers. The correlations of component scores were virtually independent of energy intake ({\textless} {\textbar}.22{\textbar}). Multiple factors underlie the {HEI-2005.} Coefficient [alpha] was .43. The [alpha] value for all tests was {.01.Conclusions}
The {HEI-2005} is a valid measure of diet quality. Potential uses include population monitoring, evaluation of interventions, and research. The individual component scores provide essential information in addition to that provided by the total score.},

	abstract = {Background. Overweight and obese persons are at risk of a number of medical conditions which can lead to further morbidity and mortality. The primary objective of this study is to provide an estimate of the incidence of each co-morbidity related to obesity and overweight using a meta-analysis. Methods. A literature search for the twenty co-morbidities identified in a preliminary search was conducted in Medline and Embase {(Jan} 2007). Studies meeting the inclusion criteria (prospective cohort studies of sufficient size reporting risk estimate based on the incidence of disease) were extracted. Study-specific unadjusted relative risks {(RRs)} on the log scale comparing overweight with normal and obese with normal were weighted by the inverse of their corresponding variances to obtain a pooled {RR} with 95\% confidence intervals {(CI).} Results. A total of 89 relevant studies were identified. The review found evidence for 18 co-morbidities which met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis determined statistically significant associations for overweight with the incidence of type {II} diabetes, all cancers except esophageal (female), pancreatic and prostate cancer, all cardiovascular diseases (except congestive heart failure), asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis and chronic back pain. We noted the strongest association between overweight defined by body mass index {(BMI)} and the incidence of type {II} diabetes in females {(RR} = 3.92 (95\% {CI:} 3.10-4.97)). Statistically significant associations with obesity were found with the incidence of type {II} diabetes, all cancers except esophageal and prostate cancer, all cardiovascular diseases, asthma, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis and chronic back pain. Obesity defined by {BMI} was also most strongly associated with the incidence of type {II} diabetes in females (12.41 (9.03-17.06)). Conclusion. Both overweight and obesity are associated with the incidence of multiple co-morbidities including type {II} diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Maintenance of a healthy weight could be important in the prevention of the large disease burden in the future. Further studies are needed to explore the biological mechanisms that link overweight and obesity with these co-morbidities.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate a revision of the Diet Quality Index called the Diet Quality Index Revised {(DQI-R)}
Design The original Diet Quality Index was revised to reflect current dietary guidance, to incorporate improved methods of estimating food servings, and to develop and incorporate measures of dietary variety and moderation. The scoring of the original scale was reversed in direction and expanded to a 100-point scale to improve interpretability.
Methods/subjects Data from the 1994 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals were used. A sample of 3,202 adults aged 18 and older contributed 2 days of dietary intake data based on 24-hour recalls for the development and revision of various components of the {DQI-R.}
Statistical analyses Pearson correlation analyses, ordinary least squares regression analyses, and a nonparametric test to determine trends across ordered groups were used.
Results The mean {DQI-R} score for the 1994 sample was 63.4 of a possible 100-point score. Sample respondents were more likely to have met dietary guidance in the areas of dietary cholesterol (66.9\% met goal) and iron intakes (59.6\% met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowances but less likely to have met goals related to fruit servings (19.6\% met goal), grain servings (23.1\% met goal), and calcium intakes (16.6\% met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowance. There is a statistically significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in all components of the {DQI-R} as one moves from the lowest grouping of scores to the highest. For example, persons with {DQI-R} scores less than 40 consumed 43.9\% of energy from fat, 72\% of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 6.7\% of the recommended servings of fruit per day. In contrast, those with {DQI-R} scores greater than 80 consumed 24.2\% of energy from fat, 101\% of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 137\% of the recommended servings of fruit per day.
Applications The {DQI-R} reflects the dietary guidance principles of macronutrient distribution, moderation, variety, and proportionality. Although the index was designed to monitor dietary changes in populations rather than individuals, each index component reflects an aspect of national dietary guidance. Calculation of {DQI-R} scores for an individual should provide an estimate of diet quality relative to national guidelines, and differences in scores over time should suggest improvement or decline in overall diet quality.

To compare three non-dieting interventions that focused on lifestyle change rather than weight loss, in terms of the sustainability of improvements in lifestyle behaviors, psychological well-being and medical symptoms at {2�years.Method}
In Dunedin, New Zealand in 2002/2003, 225 obese/overweight women {(BMI�{\textgreater}=�28;} 25-68�years) participated in a randomised, intention-to-treat trial comparing two group programs {(P1}, P2) and a self-guided mail-delivered program {(P3).} Only P1 included intensive relaxation response training. All three non-dieting interventions involved a 10-week program, followed by an eight-month support phase. Participants completed baseline, 1-year and 2-year assessments. Outcomes included behavioral, psychological and medical symptom measures and a composite success {score.Results}
118 participants completed the 2-year follow-up. Only among P1 participants were the reductions in psychological distress and medical symptoms achieved at 1�year, also maintained at 2�years. At 2�years, P1 participants had significantly greater increases in stress management behaviors than those in P2 (p�{\textless}�0.05), and significantly greater success scores than those in P3 (p�{\textless}�0.05). In all three programs, mean weight was unchanged at {2�years.Conclusion}
Inclusion of relaxation response training in a healthy lifestyle program facilitates long-term maintenance of psychological and medical symptom improvements even in the absence of weight loss.},

Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the criteria issued by the Adult Treatment Panel {III}, with the exception of central obesity, which was defined according to the Asian-Pacific criteria. Dietary information was obtained by means of a 24-hour recall and a 3-day food record, and factor analysis was used to define dietary patterns. Factor analysis identified 4 major dietary patterns, which explained 28.8\% of the total variance, based on the percentage of total daily energy intake from each food group: Korean traditional, alcohol and meats, sweets and fast foods, and fruit and dairy. After controlling for all potential confounders, we found that the Korean traditional dietary pattern was not associated with individual components of the metabolic syndrome but was significantly associated with increased odds of having metabolic syndrome. The fruit and dairy pattern was significantly associated with decreased odds of impaired blood glucose, hypertriglyceridemia, and metabolic syndrome. Our findings suggest that the fruit and dairy pattern is associated with reduced risk of having metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {The {MyPyramid} food guidance system provides recommended food intake patterns for members of each sex at various age and activity levels. These food intake patterns are based on recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. Actual consumption patterns of American adults compared to {MyPyramid} recommendations indicate that substantial changes are needed to meet the goals of {MyPyramid.} One method for encouraging dietary change, known as the small steps approach, involves small, gradual changes to meet a desired endpoint. Menu modeling was used to evaluate the effects of gradual dietary changes on diet quality. Seven days of baseline menus were developed to model the intake of adult women aged 31 to 50 years. Incremental changes were made to each baseline menu to create a series of three transitional menus and a final target menu. Target menus met {MyPyramid} energy and nutrient intake goals. Diet quality was measured for each baseline, transitional, and target menu using the Healthy Eating Index-2005. The average Healthy Eating Index-2005 score for baseline menus compared to target menus increased by more than 50 points with incremental increases observed for each transitional menu. This analysis demonstrates that small, practical changes in food choices that bring consumers closer to meeting {MyPyramid} recommendations result in gradual and dramatic improvements in diet quality. Food and nutrition professionals can use menu modeling to provide concrete examples and specific guidance for making progressive changes in food selections to meet current dietary recommendations.},

This study aimed to develop an intelligent diet management service for providing personalized dietary guidelines. Unlike existing methods that merely follow dogmatic nutrition guidelines, we proposed a flexible personalized service selection and composition method considering various individual requirements to dynamically deliver a fine-grained meal plan. In addition, intelligent input, which aims to revolutionize the way people on diet selection, is introduced to reduce the users' efforts in food searching. The intelligent input employs image recognition techniques alongside onboard nutritional information to give feedback as to whether a particular food/dish is appropriate or not for a user on a specific diet. Users can thus interact with the diet management system more easily and intuitively via the intelligent input technique. The services generated by the proposed method are expected to potentially improve the overall health and make behavioral change toward healthier life style.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the association of dietary pattern and mortality in international data. Design: Cohort study with 20 years' follow up of mortality. Setting: Five cohorts in Finland, the Netherlands, and Italy. Subjects: Population based random sample of 3045 men aged 50-70 years in 1970. Main outcome measures: Food intake was estimated using a cross check dietary history. In this dietary survey method, the usual food consumption pattern in the 6-12 months is estimated. A healthy diet indicator was calculated for the dietary pattern, using the World Health Organisation's guidelines for the prevention of chronic diseases. Vital status was verified after 20 years of follow up, and death rates were calculated. Results: Dietary intake varied greatly in 1970 between the three countries. In Finland and the Netherlands the intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol was high and the intake of alcohol was low; in Italy the opposite was observed. In total 1796 men (59\%) died during 20 years of follow up. The healthy diet indicator was inversely associated with mortality {(P} for trend �0.05). After adjustment for age, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the relative risk in the group with the healthiest diet indicator compared with the group with the least healthy was 0.87 (95\% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.98). Estimated relative risks were essentially similar within each country. Conclusions: Dietary intake of men aged 50-70 is associated with a 20 year, all cause mortality in different cultures. The healthy diet indicator is useful in evaluating the relation of mortality to dietary patterns. Key messages Studying dietary patterns instead of single nutrients in relation to mortality takes into account the intercorrelation of nutrients in the diet A healthy diet, as measured by an indicator based on {WHO} recommendations, is associated with a reduction of 13\% after 20 years in all cause mortality for men aged 50-70 The dietary pattern as a whole is more important than specific dietary components with respect to survival among older people The {WHO} dietary recommendations for the prevention of chronic diseases seem to be effective The healthy diet indicator is useful for evaluating the relation of dietary patterns and mortality in a cross cultural setting},

	doi = {10.1109/CHUSER.2011.6163724},
	abstract = {Cancer is one of the top fatal diseases in the world. When cancer patients undergo treatment, they need a different diet to help them withstand the side-effects of treatment, as well as to provide sufficient nutrition to boost the recovery cycle. Most of the dietician systems currently in the market are more in the advice area rather than recommending specific diet menus for users. These systems usually provide advice in a general form, for example: {\#x201C;Cancer} patients should eat foods with high protein {\#x201D;.} Such recommendations are insufficient to assist cancer patients with the physical preparation necessary to withstand the side effects of treatment, or with ensuring they take adequate nutrients for their body. We propose a Personalized Diet Recommendation System for Cancer Patients to help patients manage their daily food intake. The proposed system integrates the data mining techniques of Case-based Reasoning, Rule-based Reasoning and Genetic Algorithm. Case-based Reasoning is used to suggest a set of diet plans taken from the cases existing in the system, whereas Rule-based Reasoning is used to filter out irrelevant cases from the system and select the most appropriate case to be suggested to the patient. The Genetic Algorithm technique ensures that the diet menus suggested are customized according to each patient's personal health conditions. The output of the diet plan system is in the form of a list of specific nutritional values to be taken daily, and a menu recommendation suggesting actual dishes for the patient.},

Using the constant comparative method, researchers analyzed interview transcripts for recurrent ways of eating that were either explicitly reported by study participants as "routines" or emergent in the data. Participants' eating routines included repetition in food consumption as well as eating context, and also involved sequences of eating episodes. Eating routines were embedded in daily schedules for work, family, and recreation. Participants maintained purposeful routines that helped balance tension between demands and values, but they modified routines as circumstances changed. Participants monitored and reflected upon their eating practices and tended to assess their practices in light of their personal identities.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The Internet provides a widely accessible platform for weight loss interventions. Automated tools can allow self-guided monitoring of food intake and other target behaviours that are established correlates of weight change. Many programmes also offer social support from the virtual community. The aim of this research was to assess associations between engagement with self-monitoring tools and social support, and weight loss in an online weight-control programme.


{METHODS}

This paper describes a retrospective analysis of weight change among 3621 subscribers to a commercial Internet-based weight loss programme. Participants were all subscribers (2979 women; 642 men) joining the programme between July 2005 and November 2008 with two or more recorded weights spanning at least 28 days of participation in the programme. Engagement was indexed with frequency of using online diet and exercise diaries and with use of the social support forums.


{RESULTS}

Programme engagement was associated with weight loss in both men and women after controlling for initial {BMI} and duration of participation. The three engagement variables accounted for 13\% of variance in percentage weight loss in women (p {\textless} .001) and 19\% in men (p {\textless} .001). In analyses including all the engagement variables, exercise diary use was an independent predictor of weight loss among men, but non-significant in women. In contrast, use of the online forums was associated with weight loss in women but not in men. Among participants who were overweight or obese, those in the highest tertile of engagement with food diaries (vs the lowest) were more likely to achieve clinically significant ({\textgreater} 5\%) weight loss (men: {OR} = 3.45 p {\textless} .001; women: {OR} = 5.05 p {\textless} .001). Being in the highest tertile of engagement with exercise diaries was associated with clinically significant weight loss in men {(OR} = 3.48 p {\textless} .001) and, less strongly, in women {(OR} = 1.46 p {\textless} .05).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Use of self-monitoring tools and participation in online support are predictive of weight loss in the context of a commercial, online weight control programme.},

	abstract = {Electronic sensors and various digital devices have been quite successful in improving collection of physical activity data in a pervasive manner, and we believe that advances in dietary assessment can be achieved using similar strategies. Dietary assessment is a critical yet understudied component within the domain of recent advances in electronic health records management. The design of a system for real-time recording of food intake requires considerable research to optimize both system characteristics and data collection procedures, and rigorous validation to confirm its superiority compared to paper-based methods for self-report. We propose to demonstrate a functional prototype of a Dietary Data Recording System {(DDRS)}, which consists of an electronic data collection device and the software and protocols necessary to support data capture and calculation of nutrient intake. A key innovative feature of the {DDRS} is the use of a video camera and a laser-generated grid of distances to food surfaces, which allows calculation of food volume. This prototype system is a first step in designing an overall framework to support a realistic and rigorous evaluation of whether real-time, electronic collection of dietary data is feasible, acceptable and valid for betterhealth data management. Components demonstrated include a real-time data collection application based on the Google Android {OS}, a stream based data transfer and on the fly evaluation.},

The difficulties in ascertaining reliability of self-reports for events which have no external referents and the reactivity of self-monitoring limit the utility of self-observation as a control procedure in evaluating behavior therapy techniques. In clinical application, self-monitoring has been noted to modify behavior, but its controlling variables have not yet been explored. Self-observation is an initial step in self-directed behavior change. Therefore, its consideration is also required for conceptualization of self-regulatory processes, viewed as integration of response feedback utilization, self-control, and self-reinforcement, to attain self or externally prescribed performance standards.

Most of the published reports on the subject have used one of two methods to determine dietary patterns: (a) diet indexes or scores that assess compliance with prevailing dietary guidance as dietary patterns, and (b) data-driven methods that use factor or cluster analysis to derive dietary patterns. Irrespective of the approach used, patterns characterized by fruit/vegetable/whole grain/fish/poultry consumption generally have been reported to relate to micronutrient intake, and to selected biomarkers of dietary exposure and disease risk in the expected direction. Age, income, and education have been reported to be among positive predictors of the so-called more healthful dietary patterns. An inverse association of healthful dietary patterns with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk was reported in most studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction was modest and was attenuated after control for confounders. Few published studies showed an association between risk of most incident cancers and dietary patterns. Both of the currently used approaches for extracting dietary patterns have limitations, are subject to dietary measurement errors, and have not generated new diet and disease hypotheses.},

In this comparative study of 7 dietary guideline graphics, we analyzed emphasis and polarity of any hierarchy, nature (taxonomic vs chemical affinity) of food groups, specificity of prescriptive message, and symbolism in the emblem. We conclude that most emblems are not strict replicas of the {US} Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid, and varied food-group classification of key items such as legumes, potatoes, separated fats, eggs, and dairy products is expressed. Chemical affinity predominates over taxonomic aspects. In countries with large segments of illiterate citizens, nationalistic symbolism has been brought into the emblem designation.

	abstract = {Objective To develop an index of overall diet quality.

Design The Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)} was developed based on a 10-component system of five food groups, four nutrients, and a measure of variety in food intake. Each of the 10 components has a score ranging from 0 to 10, so the total possible index score is 100.

Methods/subjects Data from the 1989 and 1990 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals were used to analyze the {HEI} for a representative sample of the {US} population.

Statistical analyses performed Frequencies, correlation coefficients, means.

Results The mean {HEI} was 63.9; most people scored neither very high nor very low. No one component of the index dominated the {HEI} score. People were most likely to do poorly in the fruit, saturated fat, grains, vegetable, and total fat categories. The {HEI} correlated positively and significantly with most nutrients; as the total {HEI} increased, intake for a range of nutrients also increased.

Discussion/conclusions The {HEI} is a useful index of overall diet quality of the consumer. The {US} Department of Agriculture will use the {HEI} to monitor changes in dietary intake over time and as the basis of nutrition promotion activities for the population.

We propose that demonstrating behavior change is often infeasible as well as unnecessary for a meaningful contribution to {HCI} research, especially when in the early stages of design or when evaluating novel technologies. As an alternative, we suggest that {HCI} contributions should focus on efficacy evaluations that are tailored to the specific behavior-change intervention strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, conditioning) embodied in the system and studies that help gain a deep understanding of people's experiences with the technology.},

In this nasal provocation study, a common antihistamine approved for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was tested against placebo for evidence of additional properties. In addition to their medical examinations, the 12 study volunteers rated subjective complaints in a diary program on 4 examination days, for a duration of 4.5 hours every 15 minutes at each visit. This resulted in 903 data sets consisting of five questions each, or 4515 data points total. In this study the use of handheld computers resulted in an increase in data quality and shortened the time needed to close the database. Moreover, the benefit of electronic reminders for protocol compliance is clearly demonstrated. Our findings support the results found in the literature we reviewed. For more than 16 years, mobile computers have been supporting the implementation of clinical trials. Our review of 27 articles out of more than 100 clinical trials in which mobile computers have been used elaborates on the advantages and problems of this technology. We give a comprehensive overview of the various technologies as used in different settings, and then discuss the methodology of using mobile devices in comparison to traditional methods, the considerations that need to be made and things to be avoided in order to conduct a successful clinical trial with mobile tools.

	abstract = {Recorded self-observations on a regular basis is an important component in many health behavior interventions. Using information and communication technologies {(ICT)} and especially mobile {eHealth} applications is a promising way of improving user-friendliness and possibly the overall effectiveness of self-monitoring. Mobility as such brings the added value of continuous availability and timely information access. One additional benefit of {ICT} based solutions is the possibility for various types of customization, allowing support for a wider set of application requirements than was originally planned, and meeting changing needs and targets of individuals, groups or larger user segments. In this paper, we present a customizable mobile application for recording and managing health related self-observations, Wellness Diary, and the ideas and technical solutions for supporting tailoring of the application. The main idea is to allow end-users to freely change the data model in the application, and customize related data presentations. This work has been done in Nuadu {ITEA} project, as well as further work where the effectiveness of the mobile tool and other {ICT} technologies will be investigated in a controlled trial in Finland. We'll also present shortly a counterpart for the mobile application, a web service that should bring some added value for the end user.},

These Guidelines, published every 5 years, are developed by a national panel of experts in cancer research, prevention, epidemiology, public health, and policy, and as such, they represent the most current scientific evidence related to dietary and activity patterns and cancer risk. The {ACS} Guidelines include recommendations for individual choices regarding diet and physical activity patterns, but those choices occur within a community context that either facilitates or interferes with healthy behaviors. Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors. The {ACS} Guidelines are consistent with guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association forthe prevention of coronary heart disease and diabetes, as well as for general health promotion, as defined by the Department of Health and Human Services' 2005 Dietary Guidelinesfor Americans.},

Modern technological developments bring great promise for the realization of such large-scale persuasive behavior change interventions because they allow for user tailored interaction. For the effective tailoring of technology-based interventions, a profound understanding of the main variables underlying physical activity behavior is required. In this paper, we focus on three cognitive variables that have shown to be crucial for the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors: behavioral regulation, types of motives, and self-efficacy. In particular, we explore the relationship of these cognitive variables with actual levels of daily-life physical activity. Our study differs from related studies in two important ways. First, we consider the entire range of physical activities performed throughout the day while many studies focused on sports and or dedicated exercise. Second, we employ a wearable device for the objective measurement of daily physical activity levels rather than rely on self-report measures. Our results show that active individuals feel higher levels of self-determined behavioral regulation, experience stronger motives to be active (in particular for health and well-being related motives), and have higher levels of self-efficacy for daily-life physical activity than inactive individuals. We argue that tailored technology-based activity interventions should accommodate these cognitive variables and for inactive individuals, aim to gradually induce and internalize the cognitions already experienced by active individuals.},

	abstract = {As the number of health-related problems is increasing, consumers’ needs for food-related information are becoming more and more diverse, and so new ways to deliver the information are needed. One possibility is a hybrid of printed and electronic media that personalises messages according to the user's wishes. In the {TIVIK} project, {VTT} developed a technology that reads printed barcodes by mobile phone camera. The barcodes are used to provide product-specific information about the issues on priorities defined by the user. The system was tested for 2–3 weeks with 75 participants interested in weight management. For this group, reading the barcode gave the energy per portion for that product, also as a proportion of daily energy requirement estimated for the individual user. Users’ expectations of the system were high, implying that this kind of service is attractive. Willingness to use the system declined during the trial but was still considerable at the end of the period. In interview after the trial, rewarding features identified included feedback on one's own choices and improved understanding of the role of different products in energy intake. However, slow transfer of data and the limited number of products in the database were mentioned as problems. Utilising information technology to provide food-related information will open up new ways to develop personalised and sophisticated systems for both health services and marketing.},

Next, the domain experts construct the type-2 fuzzy ontology, then the involved volunteers are requested to input eaten items. Finally, the proposed agent displays the diet assessment of the input eaten items based on the constructed type-2 fuzzy ontology.

Methods. We analyzed data from participants in the website condition of a randomized trial designed to test the efficacy of a print- vs. website-delivered intervention. They received four stage-targeted e-mails over 8 weeks, with hyperlinks to the website. Both objective and self-reported website use data were collected and analyzed.

Results. Overall, 327 were randomized to the website condition and 250 (76\%) completed the follow-up survey. Forty-six percent (n = 152) visited the website over the trial period. A total of 4,114 hits to the website were recorded. Participants who entered the site spent on average 9 min per visit and viewed 18 pages. Website use declined over time; 77\% of all visits followed the first e-mail.

Conclusions. Limited website engagement, despite the perceived usefulness of the materials, demonstrates possible constraints on the use of e-mails and websites in delivering health behavior change programs. In the often-cluttered information environment of workplaces, issues of engagement and retention in website-delivered programs require attention.},

Method. Dietary data were collected by means of a short food frequency questionnaire as part of a Norwegian longitudinal cohort study on health behavior, lifestyle, and self-reported health of adolescents. Of 885 14-year-old baseline participants, 521 21-year-olds participated and 40\% completed all surveys at each time point.

Results. Mean weekly frequency of consumption of fruit and vegetables decreased by 1–2.5 times per week between ages 14 and 21, whereas that of sugar-containing soft drinks increased by almost 1 time per week between ages 15 and 16. Tracking of consumption patterns into young adulthood was seen for all four foods {(P} \&lt; 0.05 for differences in means between the tracking groups). The proportions of individuals remaining in the same tracking categories at the major transition stages were 50–70\%. Yet, some changed in the opposite direction of the observed trends.

Conclusions. Despite the overall changes in mean weekly frequency of consumption and prevalence of daily consumers, relative ranking by frequency at age 14 indicated some stability of eating behavior into young adulthood.},

{Design:A} quasiexperimental pretest, posttest design was used in a random sample of students in two junior high schools.
{Methods:The} intervention consisted of a combination of 5 hours of Web-based instruction and 10 hours of classroom curriculum, compared to nutrition education embedded in the standard school curriculum during a 1-month period. Participants completed six questionnaires. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t tests, and Pearson's r correlation coefficient.
Findings and {Conclusions:The} intervention group had significantly higher scores for {SE} for fruits and vegetables, {SE} for lower fat, usual food choices, and dietary knowledge of fat compared to the control group. No difference was found between groups in food consumption. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with dietary knowledge of lower fat, usual food choices, and was inversely associated with lower-fat consumption in the hypothesized model of eating behavior. The intervention was tailored to the social and developmental preferences of adolescents and effectively increased {SE} for {HE.} The mediating role of {SE} in the hypothesized model of adolescent eating behavior warrants further investigation.},

	volume = {81},
	shorttitle = {Food-based dietary guidelines},
	abstract = {Recently, the concept of food-based dietary guidelines has been introduced by {WHO} and {FAO.} For this concept, several assumptions were necessary. The validity and potential consequences of some of these assumptions are discussed in this paper on the basis of the Dutch National Food Consumption Surveys. The topics were interrelationships among dietary characteristics, nutrient density, diets in accordance with the guidelines, and food variety. To obtain insight into overall diet quality, a dietary quality index based on nutrients and a food-based quality index based on food groups were created and tested. As expected the results showed that a higher dietary quality index was associated with an improved intake of the nutrients included in the index, in particular a lower intake of total fat and cholesterol. This was related to a lower consumption of cheese, fats and oils, meat and meat products, and a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables. The information obtained with a dietary quality index can be used to assess the feasibility of a particular goal in combination with other relevant goals and to obtain clues or confirmation for recommendations regarding food consumption. The food-based quality index created showed that a combination of several food-based goals (formulated in quantitative terms) was associated with an increase in food consumption, without a clear relevance for the dietary quality. Therefore, the formulation of food-based guidelines should be based on explicitly stated dietary goals. The findings regarding nutrient density were in the direction of what was assumed, namely a positive association between density and absolute intake, although the expected effects were not completely found. The results regarding the association between variety and dietary intake were characterized mainly by differences in quantity rather than dietary quality. The data indicate that energy intake may be an important pitfall in implementing food-based dietary guidelines, that 'eat a variety of food' can be an empty slogan and that nutrient density is positively related to the absolute intake of specific micronutrients. Further, the 'absence' of interrelationships among risk nutrients indicates that a selection process has to be applied.},

To determine the best provider and the most effective format for a nutrition intervention targeting patients with low literacy skills, we conducted interviews with literacy experts and health care providers and focus groups with members of adult basic education classes. Thirty-five literacy experts and health-center-based physicians, nurses, and nutritionists in Boston, Mass, were interviewed. In addition, 50 volunteer clients from 4 Boston-based adult basic education programs participated in 6 focus groups. Results suggested that health care providers consider nutrition to be a fundamental health education topic, but that its successful inculcation in patients with limited literacy skills is hindered mostly by insufficient provider time. Almost all providers agreed that patients need to be referred to nutritionists for nutrition education. Although most providers and patients acknowledged that patients perceive physicians to be the authorities on health, patients with low literacy skills turned first to family members and friends for health information. These results suggest that effective nutrition interventions must build on patients' social networks; appear in a visually based, interactive format; and be culturally appropriate.

Participants were aware of the weaknesses their family's dietary habits and were motivated to make changes, but lacked financial, strategic, and social resources needed to do so. Based on our analysis, the current trend of raising awareness and motivation to change does not appear to address the needs of this population.

It prompts a consideration of whose agenda in being pursued, whose values are being encapsulated, and argues for a rethink and reorientation of technological interventions in this domain.

We present the Nuadu Concept, an {ICT} {(Information} and Communication Technologies) assisted wellness toolbox for the management of multiple, behavior-originated health risks. The concept is based on psychological models, which provide methods and motivation for behavior change. The individual is considered as the best expert of his/her own wellness. Thus, the Nuadu Concept provides a variety of personal wellness technologies and services, among which the user may freely choose the best tools for him/herself. We believe this approach has the potential to provide efficient, acceptable, available, and affordable wellness management support for a significant number of people.},

The {IHDPMA} provides a semantic analysis of healthy diet status for people based on the pre-constructed ontology by domains experts and results of fuzzy inference. With the generated semantic analysis, people can get healthy information about what they eat and make it easier to eat a balanced and healthy diet. The experimental platform has been constructed to test the performance of the {IHDPMA.} The results indicate that the {IHDPMA} can effectively work for healthy diet planning.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Meta-analyses of behavior change {(BC)} interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active {BC} interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified {BC} techniques improve outcome.


{DESIGN}

Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 {BC} techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating.


{RESULTS}

The 122 evaluations {(N} = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95\% confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I(2) = 69\%). The technique, "self-monitoring," explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13\%). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 vs. 0.26).


{CONCLUSION}

Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.},

A second survey elicited 65 self-shaping designs from 41 expert users, finding the Fogg Behavior Model describes how the designs were indeed persuasive. We then reviewed 85 tools based on this model to show the two dimensions that can be used to organize persuasive devices: (1) salience of a tool's self-shaping features and (2) their intended flexibility. The resulting four categories of tools are useful for researchers and designers of persuasive systems.},

A food frequency questionnaire was mailed to participants requesting them to estimate their usual intake of specific food items. Actual food consumption was determined at each meal with self-report forms. These forms required participants to indicate foods chosen at that meal. To test the validity of the frequency questionnaire, regression equations were calculated for each individual using the frequency questionnaire data as the independent variable {(X)} and actual intake data as the dependent variable {(Y).} Eighty-four percent of the r values were greater than 0.50 and 55\% were greater than 0.71. All were significant at the 0.002 level or below. As an alternative test of validity, the percentage of over- and underestimation of each food group was also assessed. Foods which are often major components of a meal (eg, flesh foods) were estimated with greater accuracy than those foods which could be considered accessory (eg, nuts or seeds). While it appears that a large percentage of individuals could accurately estimate their intake with this technique, some individuals were unsuccessful in doing so. Further research is needed to identify individual characteristics which may predict success with this technique.},

For the standard method, registered dietitians who routinely evaluate dietary data entered the recalls using a professional data entry program, {RapidCalc.} For the second method, other food and nutrition professionals were trained by the registered dietitians to use the Pacific Tracker program, a consumer-friendly dietary assessment system. Both programs use the same food composition table. Mean food group and nutrient intakes were similar for the two methods, differing by {\textless}10\% on average for both adults and children. Correlations were also high, ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 for the women and from 0.76 to 0.94 for the children. For adults and children combined, mean energy intakes were remarkably close, at 2,067 kcal/d for {RapidCalc} and 2,072 kcal/d for Pacific Tracker, although absolute differences in energy intakes were {\textgreater}300 kcal/d for 23\% of the women and 30\% of the children. Costs are much lower with the Pacific Tracker method, unless the fees for the standard method are subsidized. We conclude that the Pacific Tracker method provides an accurate and cost-effective method of dietary data entry for research purposes.},

Other interactive systems including "serious games" have been applied for the same purpose in areas such as nutrition, health and energy conservation, but they suffer from drawbacks such as inaccurate self-reporting, burdens placed on the user, and lack of effective feedback. Ambient lifestyle feedback systems overcome these challenges by relying on passive observation, calm presentation style and emotionally engaging feedback content. In this paper, we present an ambient lifestyle feedback system concept and provide insights from the design and implementation of two prototype systems, Virtual Aquarium and Mona Lisa Bookshelf. In particular, we discuss the theory and practice of effective feedback design by drawing on elementary behavioral psychology and small-scale user studies. The work is aimed at aiding in the design of ambient persuasive technologies and ambient interaction in general.},

Using data from 349 adolescent-caregiver pairs (recruited from {Minneapolis/St} Paul, {MN} metro region, 2006-2007), cross-sectional linear regression was used to assess adolescent and parental knowledge related to energy intake and expenditure as a predictor of adolescent weight-related behaviors and outcomes. Findings indicated that knowledge related to energy intake and expenditure was highly variable, with a substantial proportion of participants (particularly adolescents) lacking knowledge on a range of concepts. Adolescent knowledge was positively associated with moderate physical activity and negatively associated with television viewing {(P{\textless}0.05)}, but it was not associated with sweetened beverage consumption, fast food intake, weight status, and/or body composition. Although overall parental knowledge was a significant predictor of adolescent knowledge {(P{\textless}0.01)}, parent-child agreement on individual items was poor. As adolescents age, low literacy in this area may set the stage for poor decision-making related to energy balance and healthy weight maintenance. However, in that knowledge was not a significant predictor of various weight-related outcomes, these and other findings suggest that purely education-based health promotion strategies are insufficient to initiate long-term healthful behavior change. Educational strategies may be effective when combined with those also targeting familial, social, and environmental influences. The examination of interactive effects between individual-level and environmental influences on health behavior is an important area for future obesity-related research.},

	abstract = {Objective

To review {eHealth} intervention studies for adults and children that targeted behavior change for physical activity, healthy eating, or both behaviors.
Data Sources

Systematic literature searches were performed using five databases: {MEDLINE}, {PsychInfo}, {CINAHL}, {ERIC}, and the Cochrane Library to retrieve articles.
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Articles published in scientific journals were included if they evaluated an intervention for physical activity and/or dietary behaviors, or focused on weight loss, used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, measured outcomes at baseline and a follow-up period, and included an intervention where participants interacted with some type of electronic technology either as the main intervention or an adjunct component. All studies were published between 2000 and 2005.
Results

Eighty-six publications were initially identified, of which 49 met the inclusion criteria (13 physical activity publications, 16 dietary behaviors publications, and 20 weight loss or both physical activity and dietnext term publications), and represented 47 different studies. Studies were described on multiple dimensions, including sample characteristics, design, intervention, measures, and results. {eHealth} interventions were superior to comparison groups for 21 of 41 (51\%) studies (3 physical activity, 7 previous termdiet,next term 11 weight loss/physical activity and previous termdiet)next term. Twenty-four studies had indeterminate results, and in four studies the comparison conditions outperformed {eHealth} interventions.
Conclusions

Published studies of {eHealth} interventions for physical activity and dietary behavior change are in their infancy. Results indicated mixed findings related to the effectiveness of {eHealth} interventions. Interventions that feature interactive technologies need to be refined and more rigorously evaluated to fully determine their potential as tools to facilitate health behavior change.},

Diet-related strategies were more strongly correlated with diet-related outcomes than physical activity-related outcomes and vice versa. Measures of social interactions and self-monitoring for both diet and physical activity were consistently related to outcomes.

We sought to evaluate the accuracy of a diet score in relation to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and {obesity.Methods.}
A diet score (range 0-55) has been developed that assesses adherence to the Mediterranean diet. For the consumption of items presumed to be close to Mediterranean dietary pattern (non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, fish and potatoes) scores 0 to 5 for never, rare, frequent, very frequent, weekly and daily consumption were assigned, while for the consumption of foods presumed to be away from this pattern (red meat and products, poultry and full fat dairy products) scores on a reverse scale were assigned. Positive and negative predictive values, in relation to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and obesity status of the {ATTICA} study participants (n = 3042, enrolment 2001-02 in Athens metropolitan area, aged 18-89 years) were calculated and the 10-year {CHD} risk based on Framingham equations was estimated, {too.Results.}
The positive predictive values of the score regarding hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and obesity are: 45\% (95\% {CI} 43\%-48\%), 46\% (95\% {CI} 44\%-49\%), 12\% (95\% {CI} 11\%-14\%) and 33\% (95\% {CI} 30\%-35\%), while the negative predictive values are 86\% (95\% {CI} 85\%-88\%), 71\% (95\% {CI} 69\%-74\%), 98\% (95\% {CI} 97\%-99\%) and 97\% (95\% {CI} 96\%-98\%), respectively. Moreover, a 10-unit increase in the diet score is associated with 4\% lower 10-year {CHD} risk (± 0.1\%, p {\textless} {0.001).Conclusion.}
The proposed Mediterranean Diet Score may be useful in detecting individuals prone to the development of nutrition-related health conditions and cardiovascular disease.},

Early identification of work-related stress symptoms and early intervention could reduce individual suffering and improve the working productivity and creativity. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological variables measured at home by the users themselves or automatically. In all, 17 (3 males and 14 females, age 40-62) people participating in a work ability rehabilitation program (due to work overload) were monitored for three months. Physiological and behavioral variables (activity, bed occupancy, heart rate {(HR)} and respiration during night, {HR} during day, blood pressure, steps, weight, room illumination, and temperature) were measured with different unobtrusive wireless sensors. Daily self-assessment of stress, mood, and behaviors (exercise, sleep) were collected using a mobile phone diary. The daily self-assessment of stress and the Derogatis stress profile questionnaire were used as reference for stress status. Results show modest, but significant pooled overall correlations between self-assessed stress level, and physiological and behavioral variables (e.g., sleep length measured with wristworn activity monitor: rho = -0.22, p {\textless} 0.001, and variance of nightly bedroom illumination: rho = 0.13, p {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {Obesity is a growing healthcare challenge in present days. Objective automated methods of food intake monitoring are necessary to face this challenge in future. A method for non-invasive monitoring of human food intake behavior by the evaluation of chewing and swallowing sounds has been developed. A wearable food intake sensor has been created by integrating in-ear microphone and a reference microphone in a hearing aid case. A concept for food intake monitoring requiring low computational cost is presented. After the detection of food intake activity periods, signal recognition algorithms based on Hidden Markov Models distinguish several types of food based on the sound properties of their chewing sounds. Algorithms are developed using manual labeled records of the food intake sounds of 40 participants.},

The low response rate of the 1987-88 {NFCS} has raised concerns about potential bias, but this large data set is useful for methodologic studies and research that does not attempt to generalize the results to the {US} population. {ANALYSES:} Dietary recommendations from the 1989 National Academy of Sciences publication Diet and Health were stratified into three levels of intake for scoring. Individuals who met a dietary goal were given a score of zero. Those who did not meet a goal, but had a fair diet, were given one point, and those who had a poor diet were given two points. These points were summed across eight diet variables to score the index from zero (excellent diet) to 16 (poor diet). {RESULTS:} Lower index scores were positively associated with high intakes of other important measures of diet quality (eg, fiber, vitamin C). We found that single nutrients (such as dietary fat) were not necessarily associated with other measures of diet quality. {CONCLUSION:} We concluded that this index ranking of overall dietary patterns was reflective of total diet quality, though substantial misclassification can result from using single nutrients or foods as indicators of diet quality.},

	abstract = {In order to assess nutritional adequacy, valid estimates of nutrient intake are required. One of the main errors in dietary assessment is misreporting. The objective was to review the extent, nature and determinants of misreporting in dietary assessment, how this affects reported intakes of micronutrients and how this is identified and measured, and to identify the best ways of dealing with misreporting when interpreting results. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of misreporting of dietary intake in adults by 24 hour recalls or by estimated or weighed food records, published up to March 2008. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified. Possible causes of misreporting were identified. Methods most used to identify misreporting were the Goldberg cut-off (46 \% studies) and the doubly labelled water technique (24 \% studies). The magnitude of misreporting of energy intake was similar in all three dietary assessment methods. The percentage of under-reporters was about 30 \% and energy intake was underestimated by approximately 15 \%. Seven papers presented usable data for micronutrient intake. Absolute intakes of Fe, Ca and vitamin C (the three micronutrients addressed in all papers) were on average 30 \% lower in low-energy reporters {(LER)} than that in non-{LER} and, although results were not consistent, there was a tendency for micronutrient density to be higher in {LER.} Excluding underreporters or using energy adjustment methods for micronutrient intakes is discussed. Residual method of energy adjustment seems to be a good tool for practice to decrease an influence of misreporting when interpreting results of studies based on food records and 24 hour recalls.},

This approach calculates population-weighted nutrient composites for each food group and subgroup, assuming average choices within food groups. Nutrient estimates were compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes and other goals and limits. Recommendations were similar regarding almost all food groups for both the type and amount of foods. Primary differences were seen in the types of vegetables and protein sources recommended and the amount of dairy products and total oil recommended. Overall nutrient values were also similar for most nutrients, except vitamin A, vitamin E, and calcium. These food guides were derived from different types of nutrition research, yet they share consistent messages: eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains; eat less added sugar and saturated fat; and emphasize plant oils.},

	abstract = {Background
Comprehension of food labels can be important for patients, including those with chronic illness, to help follow dietary recommendations. Patient comprehension of food labels was examined, along with the relationship of comprehension to their underlying literacy and numeracy {skills.Methods}
From June 2004 to April 2005, a cross-sectional study of 200 primary care patients was performed. A 24-item measure of food label comprehension was administered. Literacy was measured with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine {(REALM)}, and numeracy with the Wide Range Achievement Test, third edition {(WRAT-3).Results}
Most patients (89\%) reported using food labels. While 75\% of patients reported at least a high school education and 77\% had 9th-grade literacy skills, only 37\% had 9th-grade math skills. On average, patients answered 69\% (standard deviation, 21\%) of the food-label questions correctly. Common reasons for incorrect responses included misapplication of the serving size, confusion due to extraneous material on the food label, and incorrect calculations. For example, only 37\% of patients could calculate the number of carbohydrates consumed from a 20-ounce bottle of soda that contained 2.5 servings. Higher comprehension of food labels was significantly correlated (all p values were less than 0.001) with higher income (rho=0.39), education (rho=0.49), literacy (rho=0.52), and numeracy {(rho=0.67).Conclusions}
Patients demonstrated deficits in understanding nutrition labels. Poor label comprehension was highly correlated with low-level literacy and numeracy skills, but even patients with higher literacy could have difficulties interpreting labels. Providers need to consider patients' literacy and numeracy when providing dietary recommendations. Opportunities may exist for the {U.S.} Food and Drug Administration to promote changes to make food labels more comprehensible.},

	abstract = {While health records are increasingly stored electronically, we have little access to this data about ourselves. We're not used to thinking of these official records either as ours or as something we'd understand if we had access to them in any case. We increasingly turn to the Web, however, to query any ache, pain or health goal we may have before consulting with health care professionals. Likewise, for proactive health care, such as nutrition or fitness, or post diagnosis support, to find fellow-sufferers, we turn to online resources. There is, it seems, a potential disconnect between points at which professional and proactive health care intersect. Such gaps in information sharing may have direct impact on practices we decide to take up, the care we seek, and the support professionals offer. In this panel, we consider several places within proactive, preventative health care in particular {HCI} has a role towards enhancing health knowledge discovery and health support interaction. Our goal is to demonstrate how now is the time for {eHealth} to come to the forefront of the {HCI} research agenda.},

While exploring their experiences and reasons for abandoning the system, two main themes emerged: the tension between Wii Fit as a fitness tool and a game, and ways participants reacted to the system's feedback about their weight and performance. Some participants used Wii Fit as a "gateway fitness" tool, moving beyond it to other fitness routines. Additionally, some users had significant emotional reactions to the Wii Fitts feedback. We argue that these 'side effects' are crucial considerations for the design and long-term evaluation of persuasive technologies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Estimate effectiveness of goal setting for nutrition and physical activity behavior change, review the effect of goal-setting characteristics on behavior change, and investigate effectiveness of interventions containing goal setting. {DATA} {SOURCE:} For this review, a literature search was conducted for the period January 1977 through December 2003 that included a Current Contents, Biosis Previews, Medline, {PubMed}, {PsycINFO}, and {ERIC} search of databases and a reference list search. Key words were goal, goal setting, nutrition, diet, dietary, physical activity, exercise, behavior change, interventions, and fitness. {STUDY} {INCLUSION} {AND} {EXCLUSION} {CRITERIA:} The search identified 144 studies, of which 28 met inclusion criteria for being published in a peer reviewed journal and using goal setting in an intervention to modify dietary or physical activity behaviors. Excluded from this review were those studies that (1) evaluated goal setting cross-sectionally without an intervention; (2) used goal setting for behavioral disorders, to improve academic achievement, or in sports performance; (3) were reviews. {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS:} The articles were categorized by target audience and secondarily by research focus. Data extracted included outcome measure, research rating, purpose, sample, sample description, assignment, findings, and goal-setting support. {RESULTS:} Thirteen of the 23 adult studies used a goal-setting effectiveness study design and eight produced positive results supporting goal setting. No adolescent or child studies used this design. The results were inconclusive for the studies investigating goal-setting characteristics (n = 7). Four adult and four child intervention evaluation studies showed positive outcomes. No studies reported power calculations, and only 32\% of the studies were rated as fully supporting goal setting. {CONCLUSIONS:} Goal setting has shown some promise in promoting dietary and physical activity behavior change among adults, but methodological issues still need to be resolved. The literature with adolescents and children is limited, and the authors are not aware of any published studies with this audience investigating the independent effect of goal setting on dietary or physical activity behavior. Although, goal setting is widely used with children and adolescents in nutrition interventions, its effectiveness has yet to be reported.},

	abstract = {In Japan, it has been pointed out that the number of patients afflicted with lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipemia is rapidly growing. Theses lifestyle diseases are caused from Habitual excessive drinking/eating, biased nutrition, little physical activity, sleep deprivation or stress. It is well-known that bad lifestyle habit provokes lifestyle diseases. In other words, improvement of lifestyle habit prevents these diseases from progressing. To improve eating habits (alimentary therapy), knowledge of medicine and nutrition is required because it is very important to keep a daily calorie count and to get a balanced meal. There are many studies which are focused on health care however, none of them developed functions to assist planning balanced healthy meals. This paper describes a designing and implementation of alimentary therapy assist system. The system can record users' individual data, such as gender, age, height, weight and so on. Also, this system has a function to accumulate clinical history. And this system calculates the moderate number of calories based on the individual information and medical information. Furthermore, this system has a function to accumulate user's meal history and market information, and provides the user with healthy menu based on the meal history, individual information and market information},

	abstract = {Medical informatics, broadly defined as the integration of information technology in healthcare, is revolutionizing all aspects of medicine from electronic medical record systems to portable systems that assist clinicians with medical decision-making and data entry. The human-computer interface issues in medical informatics are particularly interesting because there are often diverse user groups with different requirements for the same application (i.e., clinicians and patients).

In this dissertation, I present studies that inform the design of the Dietary Intake Monitoring Application {(DIMA)}, a patient-centered application designed to assist dialysis patients in monitoring their dietary needs. Dialysis patients who do not comply with their dietary restrictions run the risk of undergoing additional emergency dialysis, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and death. Currently, patients try to remember their fluid and sodium consumption or record it in a food diary. However, these techniques fail in 80\% of dialysis patients. We provide patients with a personal digital assistant application to record their fluid and sodium intake.

The varying levels of patient literacy and computing skills present a challenge for the design of {DIMA.} Furthermore, evaluating {DIMA} is a challenge because user studies must be conducted in dialysis wards, which are small, stressful, prohibit audio/video recordings, and change rapidly without warning. This dissertation presents methods to make patients more comfortable using {DIMA} in their everyday lives, a framework for usability studies in non-traditional environments, and interface design guidelines for people with varying literacy skills.},

	abstract = {A diary is generally considered to be a book in which one keeps a regular record of events and experiences that have some personal significance. As such, it provides a useful means to privately express inner thoughts or to reflect on daily experiences, helping in either case to put them in perspective. Taking conventional diary keeping as our starting point, we have designed and built a digital diary, named Affective Diary, with which users can scribble their notes, but that also allows for bodily memorabilia to be recorded from body sensors and mobile media to be collected from users' mobile phones. A premise that underlies the presented work is one that views our bodily experiences as integral to how we come to interpret and thus make sense of the world. We present our investigations into this design space in three related lines of inquiry: (1) a theoretical grounding for affect and bodily experiences; (2) a user-centred design process, arriving at the Affective Diary system; and (3) an exploratory end-user study of the Affective Diary with 4 users during several weeks of use. Through these three inquiries, our overall aim has been to explore the potential of a system that interleaves the physical and cultural features of our embodied experiences and to further examine what media-specific qualities such a design might incorporate. Concerning the media-specific qualities, the key appears to be to find a suitable balance where a system does not dictate what should be interpreted and, at the same time, lends itself to enabling the user to participate in the interpretive act. In the exploratory end-user study users, for the most part, were able to identify with the body memorabilia and together with the mobile data, it enabled them to remember and reflect on their past. Two of our subjects went even further and found patterns in their own bodily reactions that caused them to learn something about themselves and even attempt to alter their own behaviours.},

The Food Choice Questionnaire {(FCQ)} was developed through factor analysis of responses from a sample of 358 adults ranging in age from 18 to 87 years. Nine factors emerged, and were labelledhealth,mood,convenience,sensory appeal,natural content,price,weight control,familiarityandethical concern. The questionnaire structure was verified using confirmatory factor analysis in a second sample (n=358), and test-retest reliability over a 2- to 3-week period was satisfactory. Convergent validity was investigated by testing associations between {FCQ} scales and measures of dietary restraint, eating style, the value of health, health locus of control and personality factors. Differences in motives for food choice associated with sex, age and income were found. The potential uses of this measure in health psychology and other areas are discussed.},

We sought to identify health behavior change targets related to weight management in college students. Based on the Social Cognitive Theory model for health behavior change, we investigated the health-related lifestyle behaviors and physiological characteristics of this population. Forty-three college students (18.3�0.1 years) completed a series of quantitative assessments (eg, body weight and composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and diet and activity habits) and structured qualitative assessments (ie, structured interview or focus group). Participants were predominantly normal weight (mean body mass index 22.2�0.4) and fit (maximal oxygen consumption 50.5�1.5 {mL/kg/minute).} However, healthful eating and physical activity were not considered high priorities, despite having ample free time, high exercise self-efficacy, positive outcome expectations for exercise, and a desire to exercise more. Participants reported that regularly engaging in exercise was difficult. This may have been due to poor planning/time management, satisfaction with body image, lack of accountability, and feelings of laziness. Dietary patterns generally met recommendations but were low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Social support for exercise and healthful dietary habits were important factors associated with health behaviors. Students reported a decline in exercise and dietary habits relative to high school, which may have contributed to college weight gain. Our results suggest that this population may not have adequate self-regulatory skills, such as planning and self-monitoring, to maintain healthful behaviors in the college environment. Food and nutrition professionals working with young adults attending college may use these findings to guide the behavioral therapy component of their weight management medical nutrition therapy goals and outcomes.},

Self-monitoring is a critical skill for successful weight management. However, self-monitoring is labor-intensive and compliance is often difficult. In this paper, we describe the Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling Mobile Energy Balance {(PmEB)} cell phone application that allows users to self-monitor caloric balance in real time. We developed and applied a four-phase iterative research and development methodology. We conducted a usability study and a preliminary feasibility study. The one month feasibility study measured compliance and satisfaction among a sample of 15 participants randomized to one of three groups: 1) a paper diary group, 2) a {PmEB} group with one daily prompt, and 3) a {PmEB} group with three daily prompts. {PmEB} scored highly on usability, compliance, and satisfaction. In addition, cell phone group users scored {PmEB} the same as or better than Paper Group members scored the paper diary in nearly all categories. Thematic analysis of comments revealed very positive reviews of {PmEB} as well as areas for improvement. {PmEB} is both usable and feasible for self-monitoring in weight management, and our iterative pilot study methodology was effective in improving its usability},

None of the behaviour change techniques demonstrated clear effects in a convincing majority of the studies in which they were evaluated. Techniques targeting knowledge (n = 210 studies) and facilitation of behaviour (n = 172) were evaluated most frequently. However, self-monitoring of behaviour (positive effects in 56\% of the studies), risk communication (52\%) and use of social support (50\%) were most often identified as effective. Insufficient insight into appropriateness of technique choice and quality of technique delivery hinder precise conclusions. Relatively, however, self-monitoring of behaviour, risk communication and use of social support are most effective. Health professionals should avoid thinking that providing knowledge, materials and professional support will be sufficient for patients to accomplish change and consider alternative strategies which may be more effective.},

The availability of ubiquitous computing allows the individual to perform health-related measurements, review data or consult guidelines independent of place or time, thus providing the individual with a better means to follow certain treatment programs. In this study, we set out to implement a system based on ubiquitous computing for the application of weight management using behavioral feedback. The goals were (a) to gain insights in the technical feasibility and caveats of such a system as a basis for setting up more advanced and generic infrastructures, and (b) to study the degree to whether people are actually willing to use such a technology-laden system for their health management. The results lead us to the conclusion that such a system is possible with the current technology, although many issues need to be solved before generic architectures and implementations are a reality, and that many people, especially those who have serious weight problems, are eager to use such a system.},

	abstract = {Consumers often neglect or misinterpret nutrition table information. We argue in this paper that this can be explained by the evaluability principle, which posits that people's evaluation of a product corresponds to a greater degree with the product's actual value when people receive reference information about the product than when they do not get this information. We tested this assumption concerning nutrition table information in two studies. In Study 1, respondents received one of six nutrition tables that differed on reference and summary information about either yogurt or chocolate. In the second study, we compared three nutrition tables from the previous study, as applied to either a low nutritional value yogurt or a high nutritional value yogurt. Participants were asked to rate the attractiveness and perceived healthiness of the product in both studies. Results indicated that reference information can change people's product perception. This seems to depend, however, on the product's nutritional value and on people's primary connotation for the product. In sum, the evaluability principle can explain people's perception of a food product. A nutrition table that is adapted to this principle appears to influence people's product perception so that it becomes more in line with its nutritional value. Implications for practice and further research are given.},

With the aim of developing a new dietary instrument for assessing an individual’s usual intakes, we evaluated a hand-held personal digital assistant with camera and mobilenext term telephone card, called Wellnavi {(Matsushita} Electric Works, Ltd, Osaka, Japan).
Subjects/setting

Twenty-eight college students majoring in food and nutrition in Okayama University of Japan voluntarily participated in this study.
Design

Applying a cross-sectional study design, participants were asked to keep 1-day weighed food records. Digital images of all recorded foods were obtained simultaneously and sent to registered dietitians by a previous termmobilenext term telephone card. The following day, a 24-hour recall was obtained. These procedures were repeated after 6 months. Participants’ opinions about the three methods were determined using a questionnaire.
Statistical analysis

Differences in estimated median nutrient intake among the three methods were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Relationships among the nutrient estimates by each method were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients.
Results

We found no significant differences between the Wellnavi method when compared with food records for most nutrients, except zinc, manganese, vitamin E, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and dietary fiber. The median correlation coefficients for the nutrient estimates were 0.66 between the Wellnavi method and the food records. The survey showed that 57.1\% of subjects considered the Wellnavi method the least burdensome of the three methods and the least time consuming (16 minutes) to record daily previous termdiet.next term About half of participants indicated that they would be willing to use the Wellnavi for 1 month to record their previous termdiet.next term
Conclusions

This study suggests that a hand-held digital assistant may be a valid and convenient instrument for evaluating dietary intake.},

Working memory and other supportive cognitive processes involved in learning are reviewed in the context of developing patient education materials. We specifically focus on the impact of certain design factors such as text format and syntax, the inclusion of images, and the choice of modality on individuals’ ability to understand and remember health information.
Methods
A selective review of relevant cognitive and learning theories is discussed with regard to their potential impact on the optimal design of health materials.
Results
Working memory is measured as an individual's capacity to hold and manipulate information in active consciousness. It is limited by necessity, and well-designed health materials can effectively minimize extraneous cognitive demands placed on individuals, making working memory resources more available to better process content-related information.
Conclusions
Further research is needed to evaluate specific design principles and identify ideal uses of print versus video-based forms of communication for conveying information.
Practice implications
The process of developing health materials should account for the cognitive demands that extrinsic factors such as modality place on patients.},

{(PDA)} has become more available, this study investigated whether the use of a {PDA} would improve dietary self-monitoring frequency
and subsequent weight loss over the use of traditional paper diaries. One-hundred-seventy-six adults {(BMI} 25–39.9) participated
in a 6-month behavioral weight control program. Treatment subjects (n = 61) were provided with a {PalmZire} 21 with Calorie King’s Diet Diary software installed. Their self-monitoring habits and
weight loss were compared with the results from a previous program (n = 115) which followed the same protocol using paper diaries for self-monitoring. No significant differences in weight loss
or dietary self-monitoring were found. More frequent self-monitoring correlated with weight loss in both groups (p{\textless}.001). People seeking to lose weight should be encouraged to self-monitor and be matched with a mode of self-monitoring that
is fitting to their lifestyle and skills.},

	abstract = {There is a growing concern about chronic diseases and other health problems related to diet including obesity and cancer. The need to accurately measure diet (what foods a person consumes) becomes imperative. Dietary intake provides valuable insights for mounting intervention programs for prevention of chronic diseases. Measuring accurate dietary intake is considered to be an open research problem in the nutrition and health fields. In this paper, we describe a novel mobile telephone food record that will provide an accurate account of daily food and nutrient intake. Our approach includes the use of image analysis tools for identification and quantification of food that is consumed at a meal. Images obtained before and after foods are eaten are used to estimate the amount and type of food consumed. The mobile device provides a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on respondents that are obtained using more classical approaches for dietary assessment. We describe our approach to image analysis that includes the segmentation of food items, features used to identify foods, a method for automatic portion estimation, and our overall system architecture for collecting the food intake information.},
