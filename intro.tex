\section{Introduction}
Globally, 34\% of adults were overweight or obese in 2008 \citep{kimokoti_diet_2011}. While this has been a concern particularly in Westernized countries, the epidemic is spreading globally: Nauru in the Oceania reported the greatest gain in BMI globally \citep{finucane_national_2011}. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and certain forms of cancer \citep{guh_incidence_2009} \citep{calle_overweight_2004}. 

Self-monitoring, defined as the process of observing and recording target behavior, has been identified as a key component of behavior change in general \citep{kanfer_self-monitoring:_1970} and for weight loss in particular \citep{michie_effective_2009} \citep{burke_effect_2011}. Of the people who have lost weight and kept it off (as registered with the Weight Loss Registry), the key behavior that correlates highly with losing and keeping weight off is the practice of self-monitoring both food (energy) intake and physical activity (energy expenditure) [ref]. In general, people tend to underestimate their energy intake, while overestimating how many calories they burn in physical activity (energy expenditure) [ref]. This tendency results in an unawareness of the actual overall balance of caloric intake and expenditure, which results in weight gain. 

People underestimate energy intake for a variety of reasons, including a lack of awareness of how many calories are in food [ref]; what an appropriate serving size is [ref]; erroneous estimates of how much of a food has been eaten [ref]; and neglecting to consider calorie dense condiments or additions to a food [ref]. This effect is magnified when a person does not document what they eat as soon as they eat it, and time passes between consumption and recording [ref]. Additionally, although reflecting on food intake in the past (e.g., earlier in the day) may help raise an individual's awareness of calories in given foods, it does not enable them to make good decisions in the moment. Timely access to calorie data could help people not only capture and understand how many calories they have already consumed for the day, but also make better decisions going forward. 

People also underestimate the number of calories they burn over time. An estimate of energy expenditure by a person in a given time period is the sum of three items: the base metabolism for that individual (how many calories their body consumes for basic bodily function), the amount and intensity of intentional exercise (e.g., going for a run) and the amount and intensity of unintentional exercise (e.g., how much walking versus sitting a person does). It is relatively easy for people to measure their intentional exercise, as it's usually well-defined. However, humans tend to vastly underestimate their unintentional exercise [ref]. Readily available technology such as wearable sensors can keep track of general activity for an individual, allowing them to more closely track energy expenditure over time. 

\section{Roadmap}
Chapter \ref{cha:relatedWork} describes related work {}. Chapter \ref{cha:cont1} describes the BALANCE project, which explored one approach to supporting people in self-monitoring food intake and physical activity, key indicators in health and wellness. Chapter \ref{cha:cont2} describes background and a study that shows that there could be benefit in designing a food diary that requires less input and thinking. Chapter \ref{cha:cont3} describes the design of POND, which is a food diary based on the HEI. Chapter \ref{cha:cont4} evaluates the POND food diary. Chapter [ref] concludes this dissertation with a discussion of future work.
