\chapter{Running \LaTeX\\
  ({\it and printing if you must})}
 
 
\TeX\ has been designed to produce exactly the same document
on all computers and on all printers.  {\it Exactly the same}
means that the various spacings, line and page breaks, and
even hyphenations will occur at the same places
when the document is formatted on a variety of computers.
However, the way you edit text files and run \LaTeX\ varies
from system to system.
 
\section{Running}

Unfortunately, the author is woefully out of water where 
\TeX\ on Windows is concerned.  Google would be his resource.
On a UNIX system he types

\begin{demo}
\$\ pdflatex uwthesis
\end{demo}

and it generally works.

 
\section{Printing}
 
All implementations of \TeX\ provide the option of {\bf pdf} output,
which is all the Graduate School now requires.  Even if you intend to
print a copy or two of your thesis---the best way to admire it---create a 
{\tt pdf} anyway.  It will print anywhere.
