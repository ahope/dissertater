	abstract = {The {US} Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid is the oldest—and most widely recognized—complementary graphic to a dietary guidelines document, but others have emerged worldwide (plates, pies, rainbows, jugs, and temples) with the purpose of guiding dietary selection among food groups toward adequate nutriture and optimal health. In this comparative study of 7 dietary guideline graphics, we analyzed emphasis and polarity of any hierarchy, nature (taxonomic vs chemical affinity) of food groups, specificity of prescriptive message, and symbolism in the emblem. We conclude that most emblems are not strict replicas of the {US} Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyramid, and varied food-group classification of key items such as legumes, potatoes, separated fats, eggs, and dairy products is expressed. Chemical affinity predominates over taxonomic aspects. In countries with large segments of illiterate citizens, nationalistic symbolism has been brought into the emblem designation. Placing the least desirable foods at the pinnacle and the most desirable at the base of the graphic is problematic.},

Estimates of nutrient values associated with following each of the food guides at the 2,000-calorie level were made using a composite approach. This approach calculates population-weighted nutrient composites for each food group and subgroup, assuming average choices within food groups. Nutrient estimates were compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes and other goals and limits. Recommendations were similar regarding almost all food groups for both the type and amount of foods. Primary differences were seen in the types of vegetables and protein sources recommended and the amount of dairy products and total oil recommended. Overall nutrient values were also similar for most nutrients, except vitamin A, vitamin E, and calcium. These food guides were derived from different types of nutrition research, yet they share consistent messages: eat more fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains; eat less added sugar and saturated fat; and emphasize plant oils.},

	abstract = {To reduce the cost of analyzing dietary data for research studies, we evaluated the accuracy of an entry and assessment system that could be used by trained food and nutrition professionals who did not routinely perform this type of task. We compared intakes from 24-hour recalls for 175 adult women and 185 schoolchildren using two methods for entry of dietary data. For the standard method, registered dietitians who routinely evaluate dietary data entered the recalls using a professional data entry program, {RapidCalc.} For the second method, other food and nutrition professionals were trained by the registered dietitians to use the Pacific Tracker program, a consumer-friendly dietary assessment system. Both programs use the same food composition table. Mean food group and nutrient intakes were similar for the two methods, differing by {\textless}10\% on average for both adults and children. Correlations were also high, ranging from 0.77 to 0.96 for the women and from 0.76 to 0.94 for the children. For adults and children combined, mean energy intakes were remarkably close, at 2,067 kcal/d for {RapidCalc} and 2,072 kcal/d for Pacific Tracker, although absolute differences in energy intakes were {\textgreater}300 kcal/d for 23\% of the women and 30\% of the children. Costs are much lower with the Pacific Tracker method, unless the fees for the standard method are subsidized. We conclude that the Pacific Tracker method provides an accurate and cost-effective method of dietary data entry for research purposes.},

Individual citizens have the main responsibility for their own health and wellness management in their daily lives. Motivational tools based on modern technologies can support people in this task. Vivago Personal Wellness Manager {(PWM)} is a concept for personal wellness management, based on continuous activity monitoring with a wrist-worn device combined with immediate feedback on daily activity, e.g., sleep and physical activity. The concept allows long-term monitoring of activity patterns and includes {PC} software for detailed analysis of long-term data. We studied the ability of {PWM} to detect different levels of activity and to estimate energy expenditure. The classification accuracy of our method was 85.4\% {(SD:} 6.3, range: 71.8-94.4\%). The mean absolute error of the energy expenditure estimate was 8.7\% {(SD:} 8.0, range: 1.2-32.1\%).},

	abstract = {Recorded self-observations on a regular basis is an important component in many health behavior interventions. Using information and communication technologies {(ICT)} and especially mobile {eHealth} applications is a promising way of improving user-friendliness and possibly the overall effectiveness of self-monitoring. Mobility as such brings the added value of continuous availability and timely information access. One additional benefit of {ICT} based solutions is the possibility for various types of customization, allowing support for a wider set of application requirements than was originally planned, and meeting changing needs and targets of individuals, groups or larger user segments. In this paper, we present a customizable mobile application for recording and managing health related self-observations, Wellness Diary, and the ideas and technical solutions for supporting tailoring of the application. The main idea is to allow end-users to freely change the data model in the application, and customize related data presentations. This work has been done in Nuadu {ITEA} project, as well as further work where the effectiveness of the mobile tool and other {ICT} technologies will be investigated in a controlled trial in Finland. We'll also present shortly a counterpart for the mobile application, a web service that should bring some added value for the end user.},

Associated nutrient composition values were determined from the {NHANES} {II} database using frequency of consumption data in that survey. Portion sizes to be associated with each food item were derived from observed portion size distributions in {NHANES} {II}, based on three-dimensional models. The resulting food list and its corresponding brief data base, when used to calculate nutrients from a diet record, yielded correlations of r {\textgreater} 0.70 with the more detailed method.

	abstract = {Background: University students are commonly overlooked when diet of populations is measured and there is a lack of comprehensive dietary assessment in whole university student populations. To measure diet of undergraduate students, a new online 121-item Food Recall Checklist {(FoRC)} was designed as an alternative to a non-weighed record (food diary). This article reports the comparison between the new dietary assessment method {(FoRC)} and the food diary as a measure of energy {(kJ)}, fat (g), Non-Starch Polysaccharide {(NSP)} (g), fruit and vegetables (g), breakfast cereal (g) and bread (g) and alcohol (units) intake. Methods: Fifty-three students at the University of Aberdeen completed four days of {FoRC} then four days food diary. Median agreement and correlation between the two methods was assessed for foods and nutrients using the Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient and the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Agreement between {FoRC} and food diary was assessed using the Bland-Altman method. Results: The mean time taken to complete {FoRC} for one day was 7.4 minutes. Intakes of fat ( g and \% food energy), {NSP} and bread were similar between {FoRC} and the food diary. Median energy intake was 8185 {kJ} in the food diary and 8007 {kJ} in {FoRC.} However, {FoRC} recorded significantly lower intakes of energy and alcohol and significantly higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and breakfast cereal compared with the food diary. There was considerable variation in agreement between methods at the individual level. For all variables except alcohol and percentage energy from fat, correlation co-efficients were statistically significant and greater than 0.5. Conclusion: At the group level, four days of {FoRC} showed good median agreement with the food diary and there was high correlation between methods for most foods and nutrients. This suggests that this novel method of assessing diet can provide a useful alternative for assessing group mean intakes but that individual intakes may need to be interpreted with care.},

	abstract = {Electronic sensors and various digital devices have been quite successful in improving collection of physical activity data in a pervasive manner, and we believe that advances in dietary assessment can be achieved using similar strategies. Dietary assessment is a critical yet understudied component within the domain of recent advances in electronic health records management. The design of a system for real-time recording of food intake requires considerable research to optimize both system characteristics and data collection procedures, and rigorous validation to confirm its superiority compared to paper-based methods for self-report. We propose to demonstrate a functional prototype of a Dietary Data Recording System {(DDRS)}, which consists of an electronic data collection device and the software and protocols necessary to support data capture and calculation of nutrient intake. A key innovative feature of the {DDRS} is the use of a video camera and a laser-generated grid of distances to food surfaces, which allows calculation of food volume. This prototype system is a first step in designing an overall framework to support a realistic and rigorous evaluation of whether real-time, electronic collection of dietary data is feasible, acceptable and valid for betterhealth data management. Components demonstrated include a real-time data collection application based on the Google Android {OS}, a stream based data transfer and on the fly evaluation.},

	abstract = {Objective

To review {eHealth} intervention studies for adults and children that targeted behavior change for physical activity, healthy eating, or both behaviors.
Data Sources

Systematic literature searches were performed using five databases: {MEDLINE}, {PsychInfo}, {CINAHL}, {ERIC}, and the Cochrane Library to retrieve articles.
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Articles published in scientific journals were included if they evaluated an intervention for physical activity and/or dietary behaviors, or focused on weight loss, used randomized or quasi-experimental designs, measured outcomes at baseline and a follow-up period, and included an intervention where participants interacted with some type of electronic technology either as the main intervention or an adjunct component. All studies were published between 2000 and 2005.
Results

Eighty-six publications were initially identified, of which 49 met the inclusion criteria (13 physical activity publications, 16 dietary behaviors publications, and 20 weight loss or both physical activity and dietnext term publications), and represented 47 different studies. Studies were described on multiple dimensions, including sample characteristics, design, intervention, measures, and results. {eHealth} interventions were superior to comparison groups for 21 of 41 (51\%) studies (3 physical activity, 7 previous termdiet,next term 11 weight loss/physical activity and previous termdiet)next term. Twenty-four studies had indeterminate results, and in four studies the comparison conditions outperformed {eHealth} interventions.
Conclusions

Published studies of {eHealth} interventions for physical activity and dietary behavior change are in their infancy. Results indicated mixed findings related to the effectiveness of {eHealth} interventions. Interventions that feature interactive technologies need to be refined and more rigorously evaluated to fully determine their potential as tools to facilitate health behavior change.},

	abstract = {The presence of {3D} acceleration sensors in mobile devices has already raised a new range of context-aware applications, in particular in the sports and wellness sector. In this paper, we present an accelerometer-based step counter middleware for {J2ME-enabled} smartphones to simplify the development of activity aware applications, creating an abstraction layer between the client and the signal processing algorithms and raw sensor access. The service provides information about the step count, stop detection and changes in the phone's orientation, independently of the phone's location on the human body. The software package runs natively on Symbian S60 phones, providing an interface to {J2ME} applications and has been validated experimentally on a Nokia's N95 smartphone.},

In this study, by integrating the food composition nutrient database into an electronic healthy diet and nutrition assessment system {(eHDNAS)} to establish an informative and healthy dinning environment for the elderly. It does not only provide the elderly with more enjoyable and flexible pre-order meal services but also enable self-management of diet control. At the same time, nutritionist, nurse or the caregiver of a nursing home can do nutrition assessment for the elderly by the electronic diet records. In the future, {eHDNAS} is expected to play an important role in nutrition-caring plan.},

The “food-log” collection can provide the nutrition condition of the client for his health-survey, thus can be regarded as a good application of the system.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Excess gestational weight gain {(GWG)} is an important risk factor for long term obesity in women. However, current interventions aimed at preventing excess {GWG} appear to have a limited effect. Several studies have highlighted the importance of linking theory with empirical evidence for producing effective interventions for behaviour change. Theorists have demonstrated that goals can be an important source of human motivation and goal setting has shown promise in promoting diet and physical activity behaviour change within non-pregnant individuals. The use of goal setting as a behaviour change strategy has been systematically evaluated within overweight and obese individuals, yet its use within pregnancy has not yet been systematically explored. {AIM} {OF} {REVIEW:} To explore the use of goal setting within healthy lifestyle interventions for the prevention of excess {GWG.}


{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}

Searches were conducted in seven databases alongside hand searching of relevant journals and citation tracking. Studies were included if interventions used goal setting alongside modification of diet and/or physical activity with an aim to prevent excess {GWG.} The {PRISMA} guidelines were followed and a two-stage methodological approach was used. Stage one focused on systematically evaluating the methodological quality of included interventions. The second stage assessed intervention integrity and the implementation of key goal setting components.


{FINDINGS}

From a total of 839 citations, 54 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 5 studies met the inclusion criteria. Among interventions reporting positive results a combination of individualised diet and physical activity goals, self-monitoring and performance feedback indicators were described as active components.


{CONCLUSION}

Interventions based on goal setting appear to be useful for helping women achieve optimal weight gain during pregnancy. However, overweight and obese women may require more theoretically-designed interventions. Further high quality, theoretically-designed interventions are required to determine the most effective and replicable components for optimal {GWG.}},

To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an individually tailored, Internet-plus-email physical activity intervention designed for adult {women.Method}
Healthy and ethnically-diverse adult females {(N�=�156)} (mean age�=�42.8�years, 65\% Caucasian) from California were randomly assigned to an intervention (access to a tailored website and weekly emails) or wait-list control group. Participants completed web-based assessments of physical activity, stage of behavior change, and psychosocial variables at baseline, one month, two months, and three months. Data were collected during 2006-2007. Multilevel random coefficient modeling examined group differences in rates of {change.Results}
As compared to the control condition, the intervention group increased walking (+�69 versus +�32�min per week) and total moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (+�23 versus -�25�min per week) after three months. The intervention did not impact stage of behavior change or any of the other psychosocial {variables.Conclusion}
A tailored, Internet-based intervention for adult women had a positive effect on walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in an ethnically-diverse sample. However, given the lack of comparable research contact in the control group, these findings should be taken cautiously.},

Objective: This paper describes the development and evaluation of a text message-based intervention designed to help individuals lose or maintain weight over 4 months.
Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial, with participants being exposed to one of the following two conditions, lasting 16 weeks: (1) receipt of monthly printed materials about weight control; (2) an intervention that included personalized {SMS} and {MMS} messages sent two to five times daily, printed materials, and brief monthly phone calls from a health counselor. The primary outcome was weight at the end of the intervention. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis compared the effect of the intervention group to the comparison group on weight status over the 4-month intervention period. Analysis of covariance {(ANCOVA)} models examined weight change between baseline and 4 months after adjusting for baseline weight, sex, and age.
Results: A total of 75 overweight men and women were randomized into one of the two groups, and 65 signed the consent form, completed the baseline questionnaire, and were included in the analysis. At the end of 4 months, the intervention group (n = 33) lost more weight than the comparison group (?1.97 kg difference, 95\% {CI} ?0.34 to ?3.60 kg, P = .02) after adjusting for sex and age. Intervention participants' adjusted average weight loss was 2.88 kg (3.16\%). At the end of the study, 22 of 24 (92\%) intervention participants stated that they would recommend the intervention for weight control to friends and family.
Conclusions: Text messages might prove to be a productive channel of communication to promote behaviors that support weight loss in overweight adults.

frustrate a continued use. The paper presents a possible solution by
actively using wireless communications and ad-hoc networking techniques
to minimize the user's efforts in using the application. Overweightness
is a widespread and increasing problem in western countries. There are
indications that self-monitoring combined with guidelines provide a good
basis for personal weight management. The wireless wellness monitor
implements a self-monitoring and guidance system using Bluetooth- and
Jini-based networking. A scale, heart rate monitor, mobile terminal
(personal digital assistant or {WAP-enabled} digital cellular phone), and
home server communicate locally via Bluetooth. Internet based
communications take care of remote use. The set-up allows us to
investigate the behavior and use cases based on equipment and protocols

This paper argues that physical location alone, unless remarkably precise, may not be sufficient to express this context. Even slight localization errors may cause a mobile phone to be placed in a grocery store, as opposed to its actual location in an adjacent coffee shop. Applications such as location specific advertisements, can get affected. This paper proposes accelerometer augmented mobile phone localization {(AAMPL)}, a system that uses accelerometer signatures to place mobile phones in the right context. Early evaluation on Nokia N95 phones shows that {AAMPL} can correct locations derived from Google Maps. We believe that {AAMPL} can be extended to additional sensors (like light and sound) to further aid {GPS-free} localization.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Study objectives were to assess the accuracy of a food record delivered on a personal digital assistant {(PDA)} and to examine sources of error from the {PDA-based} food record. {METHODS:} Thirty-nine adults recruited with a newspaper advertisement were trained to record food intake using {DietMatePro}, a dietary assessment program delivered on a {PDA.} After 3 d of use, subjects returned for a follow-up visit in which a 24-h recall was conducted. Subjects also were timed while recording an observed, weighed lunch. Recalled and actual food intakes were compared with estimates recorded by the subjects when using the {PDA.} Paired sample t tests and Pearson's correlations assessed means and measurements of association between {DietMatePro} data compared with the 24-h recall data and observed meal data. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess bias in food recording. Sources of error were quantified by using calories as the unit for comparison. {RESULTS:} There were no significant differences in daily totals for calories and macronutrients between {DietMatePro} data and comparison measurements. Pearson's correlations of associations between {DietMatePro} data and the comparison measurement ranged from 0.505 to 0.797 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 28) for the 24-h recall and from 0.419 to 0.786 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 33) for the observed lunch, depending on the nutrient measured. The largest source of absolute error in caloric estimation was attributable to portion size estimation error (49\%). {CONCLUSIONS:} {DietMatePro}, a {PDA-based} dietary assessment program, provides a method of assessing energy and macronutrient intakes comparable to the 24-h recall in samples lacking dietary restrictions.},

We sought to evaluate the accuracy of a diet score in relation to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and {obesity.Methods.}
A diet score (range 0-55) has been developed that assesses adherence to the Mediterranean diet. For the consumption of items presumed to be close to Mediterranean dietary pattern (non-refined cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, olive oil, fish and potatoes) scores 0 to 5 for never, rare, frequent, very frequent, weekly and daily consumption were assigned, while for the consumption of foods presumed to be away from this pattern (red meat and products, poultry and full fat dairy products) scores on a reverse scale were assigned. Positive and negative predictive values, in relation to hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and obesity status of the {ATTICA} study participants (n = 3042, enrolment 2001-02 in Athens metropolitan area, aged 18-89 years) were calculated and the 10-year {CHD} risk based on Framingham equations was estimated, {too.Results.}
The positive predictive values of the score regarding hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and obesity are: 45\% (95\% {CI} 43\%-48\%), 46\% (95\% {CI} 44\%-49\%), 12\% (95\% {CI} 11\%-14\%) and 33\% (95\% {CI} 30\%-35\%), while the negative predictive values are 86\% (95\% {CI} 85\%-88\%), 71\% (95\% {CI} 69\%-74\%), 98\% (95\% {CI} 97\%-99\%) and 97\% (95\% {CI} 96\%-98\%), respectively. Moreover, a 10-unit increase in the diet score is associated with 4\% lower 10-year {CHD} risk (± 0.1\%, p {\textless} {0.001).Conclusion.}
The proposed Mediterranean Diet Score may be useful in detecting individuals prone to the development of nutrition-related health conditions and cardiovascular disease.},

Community efforts are essential to create a social environment that promotes healthy food choices and physical activity. Therefore, this committee presents one key recommendation for community action to accompany the four recommendations for individual choices to reduce cancer risk. This recommendation for community action recognizes that a supportive social environment is indispensable if individuals at all levels of society are to have genuine opportunities to choose healthy behaviors.

The amounts of foods eaten by individuals in five different cafeterias in Pavia, Northern Italy, were weighed by trained investigators at the time of serving and, within 5-10 min of the end of the meal, each subject was asked to quantify all foods consumed with reference to one of the three food photographs or in terms of virtual portions among those shown in the photographs. {RESULTS:} Multiple regression analysis shows that weights of portion sizes chosen from the set of photographs are significantly associated {(P{\textless}0.05)} to weights of eaten portions (beta=0.81; R(2)=0.70) and are independent of age, gender and {BMI.} The differences between mean weights of the portions chosen by individuals from photographs and mean weights of eaten foods are significant for all food categories {(P{\textless}0.05)}, except for bread. However, because of the very large number of observations, the mean differences are very small (range: from +23.2 g (+11.2\%) for first courses to -1.3 g (-2.7\%) for bread). Bland-Altman plots show that first courses limits of agreement are wide because the dispersion is increasing while weights are rising. {CONCLUSIONS:} The use of a series of three photographs and virtual portion sizes being associated with relatively small errors, our findings support the validity of using this colour food photography atlas as a tool for quantifying food portion size in epidemiological dietary surveys on different age groups of Italian subjects.},

Our approach includes the use of image analysis tools for identification and quantification of food that is consumed at a meal. Images obtained before and after foods are eaten are used to estimate the amount and type of food consumed. The mobile device provides a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on respondents that are obtained using more classical approaches for dietary assessment.

Dietary intake provides valuable insights for mounting intervention programs for prevention of chronic diseases. Measuring accurate dietary intake is considered to be an open research problem in the nutritions and health fields. In this paper, we describe a novel mobile telephone food record that provides a measure of daily food and nutrient intake. Our approach includes the use of image analysis tools for identification and quantification of food that is consumed at a meal. Images obtained before and after foods are eaten are used to estimate the amount and type of food consumed. The mobile device provides a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on respondents that are obtained using more classical approaches for dietary assessment. We describe our approach to image analysis that includes the segmentation of food items, features used to identify foods, a method for automatic portion estimation, and our overall system architecture for collecting the food intake information.},

	shorttitle = {Ancillary study to the {PREFER} trial},
	abstract = {Background: The treatment of obesity, marked by a high rate of recidivism, lacks strategies that sustain the improved lifestyle behaviors that led to the weight loss. Self-monitoring, a behavioral strategy to increase awareness of one's behavior, is the cornerstone of behavioral treatment in weight loss management. However, adherence to self-monitoring is less than ideal. The actual patterns of self-monitoring of eating behaviors in weight loss treatment programs have not been studied previously; if done, these data could provide information on how self-monitoring patterns affect weight loss and if interventions can be developed that address deficits in self-monitoring. Technology now permits an instrumented paper-and-pencil diary to record the real time of individuals' self-monitoring behaviors (invivodata, inc.), thus providing more information about self-reported behaviors. This technology differs from {PDA} based products (ex. e-diary, e-trials, logpad, {PICS)} because, to the user, it is no different from a standard paper-and-pencil diary. Methods: The purposes of this ancillary study are: (1) to describe the electronically recorded patterns of self-monitoring of eating behaviors by weight-loss study participants; (2) compare reported vs. electronically recorded self-monitoring; and (3) examine the relationship between the electronically validated adherence to self-monitoring goals and success in weight loss in a sub-sample of participants in the {PREFER} study. This paper describes the design, methods and preliminary 6-month results. Results: Preliminary results reveal that participants frequently report recording their eating behavior during times when the binder was not opened. Two examples of data are shown that demonstrate the lack of concordance between the self-reported and the electronically recorded data. Conclusions: These unobtrusively collected electronic data can lead to the development of strategies that can promote improved adherence to self-monitoring. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

	doi = {10.1109/CHUSER.2011.6163724},
	abstract = {Cancer is one of the top fatal diseases in the world. When cancer patients undergo treatment, they need a different diet to help them withstand the side-effects of treatment, as well as to provide sufficient nutrition to boost the recovery cycle. Most of the dietician systems currently in the market are more in the advice area rather than recommending specific diet menus for users. These systems usually provide advice in a general form, for example: {\#x201C;Cancer} patients should eat foods with high protein {\#x201D;.} Such recommendations are insufficient to assist cancer patients with the physical preparation necessary to withstand the side effects of treatment, or with ensuring they take adequate nutrients for their body. We propose a Personalized Diet Recommendation System for Cancer Patients to help patients manage their daily food intake. The proposed system integrates the data mining techniques of Case-based Reasoning, Rule-based Reasoning and Genetic Algorithm. Case-based Reasoning is used to suggest a set of diet plans taken from the cases existing in the system, whereas Rule-based Reasoning is used to filter out irrelevant cases from the system and select the most appropriate case to be suggested to the patient. The Genetic Algorithm technique ensures that the diet menus suggested are customized according to each patient's personal health conditions. The output of the diet plan system is in the form of a list of specific nutritional values to be taken daily, and a menu recommendation suggesting actual dishes for the patient.},

	abstract = {Consumers often neglect or misinterpret nutrition table information. We argue in this paper that this can be explained by the evaluability principle, which posits that people's evaluation of a product corresponds to a greater degree with the product's actual value when people receive reference information about the product than when they do not get this information. We tested this assumption concerning nutrition table information in two studies. In Study 1, respondents received one of six nutrition tables that differed on reference and summary information about either yogurt or chocolate. In the second study, we compared three nutrition tables from the previous study, as applied to either a low nutritional value yogurt or a high nutritional value yogurt. Participants were asked to rate the attractiveness and perceived healthiness of the product in both studies. Results indicated that reference information can change people's product perception. This seems to depend, however, on the product's nutritional value and on people's primary connotation for the product. In sum, the evaluability principle can explain people's perception of a food product. A nutrition table that is adapted to this principle appears to influence people's product perception so that it becomes more in line with its nutritional value. Implications for practice and further research are given.},

All participants received a physical activity leaflet and those in the {ECI} group also received a one-to-one interview with a dietitian a week after their routine appointment. Both self-reported physical activity levels and stage of change were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks. {RESULTS:} Thirty-four participants (17 in each group) completed the study. Both groups showed an increase in physical activity levels. However, there was a significant difference in change of physical activity levels in the {ECI} group alone {[F(1,32)=15.99;P{\textless}or=0.01].} In the {ECI} group, eight participants increased their stage of change compared with just one in the control group.

As a possible method for decreasing rates of obesity, we focused on controlling food intake implicitly without any effort. We hypothesized that ambiguous perception of satiety can be applied to control our food intake. Recent psychological studies have revealed that the amount of food consumed is influenced by both its actual volume and external factors during eating. Based on this knowledge, we sought to control perception of satiety gained from the same amount of food by changing its apparent size. We also proposed a method for food-volume augmentation using real-time shape deformation. Our results suggest that this augmentation can control the perception of satiety and food intake.},

	abstract = {The main contribution of this paper is to realize computer generated augmented flavors and establish a method to integrate gustatory information into computer human interactions. There are several reasons for the scarcity of research on gustatory information. One reason is that taste sensations are affected by a number of factors, such as vision, olfaction and memories. This produces a complex cognition mechanism for a user's gustatory sensation, and makes it difficult to build up a gustatory display which produces a specific taste on demand. Our hypothesis is that the complexity of gustatory sensation can be applied to the realization of a {"Pseudo-gustatory"} display that presents the desired flavors by means of a cross-modal effect elicited by visual and olfactory augmented reality. We propose the Edible Marker system, which can detect the state [number/shape/6-degree-of-freedom {(DOF)} coordinate] of each piece of bitten or divided food in real time, and the {"Pseudo-gustation"} method to change the perceived taste of food by changing its appearance and scent. We construct {"MetaCookie+"} as an implementation and discuss its validity through an exploratory study.},

To study related issues, we developed a location-based reminder system, {PlaceMail}, and demonstrate its utility in supporting everyday tasks through a month-long field study. We identify current tools and practices people use to manage distributed tasks and note problems with current methods, including the common "to-do list". Our field study shows that {PlaceMail} supports useful location-based reminders and functional place-based lists. The study also sheds rich and surprising light on a new issue: when and where to deliver location-based information. The traditional 'geofence' radius around a place proves insufficient. Instead, effective delivery depends on people's movement patterns through an area and the geographic layout of the space. Our results both provide a compelling demonstration of the utility of location-based information and raise significant new challenges for location-based information distribution.},

	abstract = {Context: The expansion and adoption of new methods of communication provide new opportunities for delivering health behavior change interventions. This paper reviews the current research examining mobile telephone short-message service {(SMS)} for delivering health behavior change interventions via text messages. This service has wide Population reach, can be individually tailored, and allows instant delivery with asynchronous receipt, suggesting potential as a delivery channel for health behavior interventions. Evidence qcquisition: An electronic database search was conducted for studies published between January 1990 and March 2008. Studies were included in the review if they (1) evaluated an intervention delivered primarily via {SMS}, (2) assessed change in health behavior using pre-post assessment, and (3) were published in English in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Evidence synthesis: Of 33 studies identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria. Four of the 14 studies reviewed targeted preventive health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation), and ten focused on clinical care (e.g., diabetes self-management). Positive behavior change outcomes were observed in 13 of the 14 reviewed studies. Intervention initiation (researcher or participant), {SMS} dialogue initiation, tailoring of {SMS} content, and interactivity were found to be important features of {SMS-delivered} interventions. Methodologic issues with current {SMS} research were also identified. Conclusions: This review suggests that {SMS-delivered} interventions have positive short-term behavioral outcomes. Further research is required to evaluate interventions for preventive health behaviors that incorporate features found to affect behavioral outcomes and participant acceptance. The quality of studies in this emerging field of research needs to improve to allow the full potential of this medium to be explored.},

This paper investigates the use of mobile guides in fitness activities, proposing the Mobile Personal Trainer {(MOPET)} application. {MOPET} uses a {GPS} device to monitor user's position during her physical activity in an outdoor fitness trail. It provides navigation assistance by using a fitness trail map and giving speech directions. Moreover, {MOPET} provides motivation support and exercise demonstrations by using an embodied virtual trainer, called Evita. Evita shows how to correctly perform the exercises along the trail with {3D} animations and incites the user. To the best of our knowledge, our project is the first to employ a mobile guide for fitness activities. The effects of {MOPET} on motivation, as well as its navigational and training support, have been experimentally evaluated with 12 users. Evaluation results encourage the use of mobile guides and embodied virtual trainers in outdoor fitness applications.},

Interactions with widgets take place through a so-called widget engine, which is a specialized client-side runtime component that also provides functionalities for managing widgets. As the number of supported widgets increases, managing widgets becomes increasingly complex. For example, finding relevant or interesting widgets becomes difficult and the user interface easily gets cluttered with irrelevant widgets. In addition, interacting with information sources can be cumbersome, especially on mobile platforms. In order to facilitate widget management and interactions, we have developed Capricorn, an intelligent user interface that integrates adaptive navigation techniques into a widget engine. This paper describes the main functionalities of Capricorn and presents the results of a usability evaluation that measured user satisfaction and compared how user satisfaction varies between desktop and mobile platforms.},

Obesity in childhood is resistant to interventions that involve only recommendations to decrease caloric intake and to increase caloric expenditure. The challenge with this approach to childhood obesity is twofold: It is neither theoretically based nor does it consider the children's or their parent's perceptions of their health problems. Of significance, this traditional approach also ignores the transition along the stages of behavioral change. Case management has proven to be successful in managing various chronic health problems in both adults and children. This case study will present a new intervention model to treat childhood obesity based on the transtheoretical framework utilizing case management in a primary care setting.},

The majority of the participants (58\%) perceived that they maintained 5 or more servings per day for 24 months. These maintainers had a higher intake at each time point for all dietary measures and differed from those who failed to progress (11\%) for most transtheoretical model variables. {IMPLICATIONS:} The intervention was effective in increasing the intake of fruits and vegetables in older adults.

For 26 nutrients, correlations and attenuation coefficients were somewhat higher for the {DHQ} versus the Block {FFQ}, and both were better than the Willett {FFQ} in models unadjusted for energy. Energy adjustment increased correlations and attenuation coefficients for the Willett {FFQ} dramatically and for the {DHQ} and Block {FFQ} instruments modestly. The {DHQ} performed best overall. These data show that the {DHQ} and the Block {FFQ} are better at estimating absolute intakes than is the Willett {FFQ} but that, after energy adjustment, all three are more comparable for purposes of assessing diet-disease risk.},

This systematic review explores how computer-tailored, behavioral interventions implemented and delivered via the Web have been operationalized in a variety of {settings.Methods}
Computer-tailored, online behavioral intervention studies published from 1996 to early 2007 were selected and reviewed by two independent {coders.Results}
Of 503 studies screened, 30 satisfied the selection criteria. The level of sophistication of these interventions varied from immediate risk/health assessment, tailored web content to full-blown customized health programs. The most common variables for tailoring content were health behaviors and stages of change. Message tailoring was achieved through a combination mechanisms including: feedback, personalization and {adaptation.Conclusions}
Tailored, self-guided health interventions delivered via the Web to date have involved a great diversity of features and formats. While some programs have been relatively brief and simple, others have involved complex, theory-based tailoring with iterative assessment, tools for development of self-regulatory skills, and various mechanisms for providing {feedback.Practice} implications
Our ability to fully optimize the use of computer-assisted tailoring will depend on the development of empirically based guidelines for tailoring across populations, health foci, health behaviors and situations. Further outcome research is needed to enhance our understanding of how and under what conditions computer-tailoring leads to positive health outcomes in online behavioral interventions.},

This article discusses how we have adapted and applied traditional methods from psychology and human-computer interaction, such as Wizard of Oz and Experience Sampling, to be more amenable to the in situ evaluations of ubiquitous computing applications, particularly in the early stages of design. The way that ubiquitous computing technologies can facilitate the in situ collection of self-report data is also discussed. Although the focus is on ubiquitous computing applications and tools for their assessment, it is believed that the in situ evaluation tools that are proposed will be generally useful for field trials of other technology, applications, or formative studies that are concerned with collecting data in situ.},

Significant associations with stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy were found, though there was no association with attitudes to health (general or oral). {CONCLUSION:} The findings suggest that the Transtheoretical Model (and its key constructs) may be a useful framework through which more tailored health promotion interventions can be designed.},

	abstract = {The cost of health care in the United States has been increasing at an annual rate of 9.8\%, faster than the cost of living, since 1970. This is due to many factors, the most significant being preventable and manageable chronic conditions and diseases, known as comorbidities. These comorbidities are associated with individuals who classify as being overweight or obese, representing 68\% of the United States population. This creates a strain on the health care system and the economy. Decreasing the number of overweight or obese individuals is necessary to reduce the prevalence of weight-related comorbidities. This can be accomplished through establishing and maintaining the proper energy balance between caloric intake and physical activity. The government leads many efforts to educate individuals on the importance of incorporating nutrition and physical activity. Since limited budgets for encouraging participation exist, a need exists for a system designed to assist policy makers in determining which age cohorts, or groups, given a level of adherence to recommendations, would result in the most benefit to stakeholders. An analysis was conducted to determine which 10-year age cohort(s) should be targeted for health promotion in efforts to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obese individuals. Each age cohort's participation and predicted weight loss was simulated using a validated weight prediction model. Weight loss resulted from partial cohort adherence to nutritional and physical activity recommendations. Design Alternatives were evaluated on effectiveness, determined by weight loss The analysis showed that if 30, 60, or 90 percent of a given cohort adhered to government recommendations, the 60-year age cohorts' outcome would result in the greatest benefit for the smallest cost. The remaining alternatives were ranked based on their cost benefit. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine if the results were sensitive to changes of the importance of the b- - enefit measures. The results demonstrated that the 60-year age cohort was the best alternative in all cases.},

	abstract = {Physical activity has a positive impact on people's well-being, and it may also decrease the occurrence of chronic diseases. Activity recognition with wearable sensors can provide feedback to the user about his/her lifestyle regarding physical activity and sports, and thus, promote a more active lifestyle. So far, activity recognition has mostly been studied in supervised laboratory settings. The aim of this study was to examine how well the daily activities and sports performed by the subjects in unsupervised settings can be recognized compared to supervised settings. The activities were recognized by using a hybrid classifier combining a tree structure containing a priori knowledge and artificial neural networks, and also by using three reference classifiers. Activity data were collected for 68 h from 12 subjects, out of which the activity was supervised for 21 h and unsupervised for 47 h. Activities were recognized based on signal features from 3-D accelerometers on hip and wrist and {GPS} information. The activities included lying down, sitting and standing, walking, running, cycling with an exercise bike, rowing with a rowing machine, playing football, Nordic walking, and cycling with a regular bike. The total accuracy of the activity recognition using both supervised and unsupervised data was 89\% that was only 1\% unit lower than the accuracy of activity recognition using only supervised data. However, the accuracy decreased by 17\% unit when only supervised data were used for training and only unsupervised data for validation, which emphasizes the need for out-of-laboratory data in the development of activity-recognition systems. The results support a vision of recognizing a wider spectrum, and more complex activities in real life settings.},

Two-stage classification questions were compared with a behavior question about thermometer use, and validated using Cronbach's if-item-deleted option for alpha. Concurrent validity was assessed using cross-tabulation chi2 test. The detailed classification question more accurately classified respondents in both Consumer and Extension groups. Cronbach's alpha of the detailed question with the behavior question showed a consistency level of alpha=.73 compared to alpha=.35 for the simple question format. As expected, Consumer and Extension groups differed significantly in their stages of change {(P{\textless}0.0001)}, verifying concurrent validity.

The questionnaire structure was verified using confirmatory factor analysis in a second sample (n=358), and test-retest reliability over a 2- to 3-week period was satisfactory. Convergent validity was investigated by testing associations between {FCQ} scales and measures of dietary restraint, eating style, the value of health, health locus of control and personality factors. Differences in motives for food choice associated with sex, age and income were found. The potential uses of this measure in health psychology and other areas are discussed.},

Twenty-eight college students majoring in food and nutrition in Okayama University of Japan voluntarily participated in this study.
Design

Applying a cross-sectional study design, participants were asked to keep 1-day weighed food records. Digital images of all recorded foods were obtained simultaneously and sent to registered dietitians by a previous termmobilenext term telephone card. The following day, a 24-hour recall was obtained. These procedures were repeated after 6 months. Participants’ opinions about the three methods were determined using a questionnaire.
Statistical analysis

Differences in estimated median nutrient intake among the three methods were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Relationships among the nutrient estimates by each method were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients.
Results

We found no significant differences between the Wellnavi method when compared with food records for most nutrients, except zinc, manganese, vitamin E, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and dietary fiber. The median correlation coefficients for the nutrient estimates were 0.66 between the Wellnavi method and the food records. The survey showed that 57.1\% of subjects considered the Wellnavi method the least burdensome of the three methods and the least time consuming (16 minutes) to record daily previous termdiet.next term About half of participants indicated that they would be willing to use the Wellnavi for 1 month to record their previous termdiet.next term
Conclusions

This study suggests that a hand-held digital assistant may be a valid and convenient instrument for evaluating dietary intake.},

	abstract = {Objective: Development of an evaluation tool of psychosocial constructs for use by participants in 2 federal programs, Food Stamp Nutrition Education and the Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program. Design: Cross-sectional data from a longitudinal study. Participants: Limited-resource women (n = 111) living in low-income communities. Measures: Test-retest reliability, internal consistency, ethnic differences, convergent validity. Analysis: Spearman rank order correlation, analysis of variance, principal components analysis. Results: Reliability coefficients ranged from a low of r = .18 (not significant) to r = .74 {(P} {\textless} .0001). Two items were deleted for not meeting criteria for reliability and 2 for redundancy. Ethnic differences at baseline were significant for 1 item. Domain constructs loaded on 4 to 5 factors for the biopsychosocial framework. Estimates of convergent validity of 9 constructs led to the deletion of 3 (ie, perceived barriers, social support, and perceived norms), with retention of perceived benefits, perceived control, self-efficacy, readiness to eat more fruit, readiness to eat more vegetables, and perceived diet quality. As an estimate of convergent validity, the final version of the tool with 6 constructs remaining showed significant correlations with indicators of diet quality: serum carotenoid values (r = .38, P {\textless} .001); hypothesized nutrients calculated from the mean of 3 24-hour dietary recalls (vitamin C, r = .47, P {\textless} .0001; vitamin A, r = .39, P {\textless} .0001; folate, r = .37, P {\textless} .0001; beta-carotene, r =.31, P {\textless} .001; and fiber, r = .46, P {\textless} .0001); fruit and vegetable servings (r = 0.55, P {\textless} .0001); Healthy Eating Index (r = .27, P {\textless} .05); and a fruit and vegetable behavioral scale (r = .60, P {\textless} .0001). Conclusion and Implications: This systematic process yielded a fruit and vegetable evaluation tool useful for practitioners and researchers. This is the first validation study of this type to estimate convergent validity with 5 indicators of diet quality, including a biomarker. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]} Copyright of Journal of Nutrition Education \& Behavior is the property of Elsevier Science and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

An interagency working group based the {HEI-2005} on the food patterns found in {MyPyramid.} Diets that meet the least restrictive of the food-group recommendations, expressed on a per 1,000 calorie basis, receive maximum scores for the nine adequacy components of the index: total fruit (5 points), whole fruit (5 points), total vegetables (5 points), dark green and orange vegetables and legumes (5 points), total grains (5 points), whole grains (5 points), milk (10 points), meat and beans (10 points), and oils (10 points). Lesser amounts are prorated linearly. Population probability densities were examined when setting the standards for minimum and maximum scores for the three moderation components: saturated fat (10 points), sodium (10 points), and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages (ie, beer, wine, and distilled spirits), and added sugars (20 points). Calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars is a proxy for the discretionary calorie allowance. The 2005 Dietary Guideline for saturated fat and the Adequate Intake and Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium, expressed per 1,000 calories, were used when setting the standards for those components. Intakes between the maximum and minimum standards are prorated. The {HEI-2005} is a measure of diet quality as described by the key diet-related recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines. It has a variety of potential uses, including monitoring the diet quality of the {US} population and subpopulations, evaluation of interventions, and research.},

The low response rate of the 1987-88 {NFCS} has raised concerns about potential bias, but this large data set is useful for methodologic studies and research that does not attempt to generalize the results to the {US} population. {ANALYSES:} Dietary recommendations from the 1989 National Academy of Sciences publication Diet and Health were stratified into three levels of intake for scoring. Individuals who met a dietary goal were given a score of zero. Those who did not meet a goal, but had a fair diet, were given one point, and those who had a poor diet were given two points. These points were summed across eight diet variables to score the index from zero (excellent diet) to 16 (poor diet). {RESULTS:} Lower index scores were positively associated with high intakes of other important measures of diet quality (eg, fiber, vitamin C). We found that single nutrients (such as dietary fat) were not necessarily associated with other measures of diet quality. {CONCLUSION:} We concluded that this index ranking of overall dietary patterns was reflective of total diet quality, though substantial misclassification can result from using single nutrients or foods as indicators of diet quality.},

	abstract = {{Objective/Design}
Time and budget constraints limit nutrition evaluation in Canadian health surveys. To encourage regular population diet monitoring in Canada, we developed and assessed the relative validity of a population-based food frequency questionnaire {(FFQ)} to assess usual diet in Quebecers. A 73-item, self-administered semiquantitative {FFQ} was designed in French and English from the Block National Cancer Institute Health Habits and History Questionnaire to capture usual food consumption among Quebec adults. The {US} Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)} (maximum score=100) was adapted to Canadian age- and sex-specific dietary recommendations, validated, and programmed to score the {FFQ} for diet {quality.Subjects}
The {FFQ} was pretested, pilot tested, and administered by mail to a random sample of 248 adults aged 18 to 82 years in the Montreal area (57\% women) who were recruited by random digit dialing (64\% response rate). A subgroup (n=94) furnished four nonconsecutive 1-day food records for validation of the {FFQ.Results}
Mean {FFQ} energy intakes were 2,216 kcal (median 2,110 kcal) for men and 1,785 kcal (median 1,680 kcal) for women. Proportional median macronutrient consumption was similar in both sexes at 17\% protein, 34\% to 35\% fats, and 48\% to 49\% carbohydrates, but differed by age group in women. Adequacy of micronutrient intakes relative to Dietary Reference Intakes varied by age, sex, and nutrient. Whereas most mean or median intakes were at or exceeded recommendations, calcium intakes were low overall and levels of several other nutrients were very low at the 10th percentile. Mean Canadian {HEI} (range 46 to 99) was higher in women (74.9) than men (70.3, P{\textless}.001). Women's scores showed they met recommendations for intakes of vegetables and fruit, cholesterol, and sodium better than men {(P} ranged from {\textless}.01 to {\textless}.0001), while men fared better at meeting recommended fat intake levels {(P{\textless}.05).Conclusions}
The Canadian {HEI} adequately discriminates overall diet quality based on dietary data estimated from our {FFQ.} Examination of subscores within and between quartiles may best reveal which food groups require attention to improve diet quality, providing valuable information for teaching and planning. Future studies should test diet quality indicators in populations recruited to reflect greater dietary diversity and reporting ability and include members of disadvantaged groups to provide a broader set of behaviors that could shed light on factors influencing diet quality.},

	abstract = {Optimization problems arise naturally in many different disciplines. One of them is nutrition. There is an interesting problem of dietary menu planning, where the goal, or objective, may be to maximize the number of seasonal and functional foods and to minimize the cost and deviations from uniformly distributed aesthetic standards for taste, consistency, color, temperature, shape, and method of preparation.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate the association of dietary pattern and mortality in international data. Design: Cohort study with 20 years' follow up of mortality. Setting: Five cohorts in Finland, the Netherlands, and Italy. Subjects: Population based random sample of 3045 men aged 50-70 years in 1970. Main outcome measures: Food intake was estimated using a cross check dietary history. In this dietary survey method, the usual food consumption pattern in the 6-12 months is estimated. A healthy diet indicator was calculated for the dietary pattern, using the World Health Organisation's guidelines for the prevention of chronic diseases. Vital status was verified after 20 years of follow up, and death rates were calculated. Results: Dietary intake varied greatly in 1970 between the three countries. In Finland and the Netherlands the intake of saturated fatty acids and cholesterol was high and the intake of alcohol was low; in Italy the opposite was observed. In total 1796 men (59\%) died during 20 years of follow up. The healthy diet indicator was inversely associated with mortality {(P} for trend �0.05). After adjustment for age, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the relative risk in the group with the healthiest diet indicator compared with the group with the least healthy was 0.87 (95\% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.98). Estimated relative risks were essentially similar within each country. Conclusions: Dietary intake of men aged 50-70 is associated with a 20 year, all cause mortality in different cultures. The healthy diet indicator is useful in evaluating the relation of mortality to dietary patterns. Key messages Studying dietary patterns instead of single nutrients in relation to mortality takes into account the intercorrelation of nutrients in the diet A healthy diet, as measured by an indicator based on {WHO} recommendations, is associated with a reduction of 13\% after 20 years in all cause mortality for men aged 50-70 The dietary pattern as a whole is more important than specific dietary components with respect to survival among older people The {WHO} dietary recommendations for the prevention of chronic diseases seem to be effective The healthy diet indicator is useful for evaluating the relation of dietary patterns and mortality in a cross cultural setting},

Most of the published reports on the subject have used one of two methods to determine dietary patterns: (a) diet indexes or scores that assess compliance with prevailing dietary guidance as dietary patterns, and (b) data-driven methods that use factor or cluster analysis to derive dietary patterns. Irrespective of the approach used, patterns characterized by fruit/vegetable/whole grain/fish/poultry consumption generally have been reported to relate to micronutrient intake, and to selected biomarkers of dietary exposure and disease risk in the expected direction. Age, income, and education have been reported to be among positive predictors of the so-called more healthful dietary patterns. An inverse association of healthful dietary patterns with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk was reported in most studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction was modest and was attenuated after control for confounders. Few published studies showed an association between risk of most incident cancers and dietary patterns. Both of the currently used approaches for extracting dietary patterns have limitations, are subject to dietary measurement errors, and have not generated new diet and disease hypotheses.},

In this review, the methodology used to develop dietary indices and their relationship with health determinants and outcomes is discussed. In brief, the already proposed indices are adequate tools concerning the evaluation of diet quality, but they have shown moderate predictive ability in relation to chronic diseases and health determinants. The aforementioned weaknesses could be attributed to: inappropriate selection of the components (i.e., number or content of dietary information), selection of small number of cut-off points for each component and/or equal contribution of all index items to the calculation of the total score. Nevertheless, dietary indices are important tools to evaluate not only the diet quality, but also the relationship between dietary habits and several health outcomes.},

	abstract = {This study tested the independent and interactive effects of anxiety and dietary restraint on the relative reinforcing value of snack food. Thirty non-obese, female university students were assigned to one of four groups based on median split scores on measures of dietary restraint and state-anxiety: low-restraint/low-anxiety (n�=�7), low-restraint/high-anxiety (n�=�7), high-restraint/low-anxiety (n�=�9), and high-restraint/high-anxiety (n�=�7). Participants were provided the choice to earn points for palatable snack foods or fruits and vegetables using a computerized concurrent schedules choice task. The behavioural cost to gain access to snack foods increased across trials, whereas the cost to gain access to fruits and vegetables was held constant across trials. The relative reinforcing value of palatable snack food in relation to fruits and vegetables was defined as the total amount of points earned for snack food. Two-way analysis of covariance, with hunger and hedonic snack food ratings as covariates, showed that dietary restraint and anxiety had a significant interactive effect on the relative reinforcing value of snack food, indicating that the effect of anxiety on snack food reinforcement is moderated by dietary restraint. Specifically, the high-anxiety/low-restraint women found snack food significantly less reinforcing than low-anxiety/low-restraint women, but no differences emerged between high- and low-anxiety women with high-restraint. Neither restraint nor anxiety had an independent effect on the relative reinforcing value of snack food. These findings indicate that anxiety may have a suppressive effect on the relative reinforcing value of snack food in low-restrained eaters, but not an enhancing effect on snack food reinforcement in high-restrained eaters. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.},

Food intake assessment is important for obesity management, which has shown significant impacts in public healthcare. Conventional dietary record based food intake assessment methods exhibit insufficient popularity due to their low accuracy and high dependence on human interactions. Image based food recognition appears recently. But it is still under development and far away from field applications. This paper presents {DietCam}, a camera phone based application to evaluate food intakes automatically from multiple perspectives. Food recognition from images is afflicted currently with a low recognition accuracy caused by the uncertainties of food appearances. The deformable nature of food items together with the complex background environment makes the problem even harder. {DietCam} separates every food item through evaluating the best perspective and recognize each of them from multiple images with a probabilistic method. The recognition accuracy is increased through an enhanced joint distribution from every viewpoint. A prototype of {DietCam} has been implemented on {iPhone.} In the field experiments, it shows an accuracy of 84\% for regular shape food items.},

Both experiential and behavioral processes predicted forward transition out of precontemplation and forward transition into action, whereas only behavioral processes predicted forward transition out of contemplation.

For measurement of real-world intake, the diet-previous termdiarynext term technique is imperfect and tends to underestimate actual intakes but it appears to be sensitive, can detect subtle influences on eating behavior, and produces reliable and valid measures. Research studies in the real world show the multivariate richness of the natural environment, which allows investigation of the complexities of intake regulation, and even causation can be investigated. Real-world research can overcome some of the weaknesses of laboratory studies, where constraints on eating are often removed or missing, facilitatory influences on eating are often controlled or eliminated, the importance of variables can be overestimated, and important influences can be missed because of the short durations of the studies. Real-world studies have shown a wide array of physiologic, psychological, and social variables that can have potent and immediate effects on intake. Compensatory mechanisms, including some that operate with a 2- to 3-d delay, adjust for prior excesses. Heredity affects all aspect of previous termfoodnext term-intake regulation, from the determination of body size to the subtleties of the individual preferences and social proclivities and the extent to which environmental factors affect the individual.

Using the constant comparative method, researchers analyzed interview transcripts for recurrent ways of eating that were either explicitly reported by study participants as "routines" or emergent in the data. Participants' eating routines included repetition in food consumption as well as eating context, and also involved sequences of eating episodes. Eating routines were embedded in daily schedules for work, family, and recreation. Participants maintained purposeful routines that helped balance tension between demands and values, but they modified routines as circumstances changed. Participants monitored and reflected upon their eating practices and tended to assess their practices in light of their personal identities. These findings provide conceptual insights for food choice researchers and present a perspective from which practitioners who work with individuals seeking to adopt healthful eating practices might usefully approach their tasks.},

In this paper, we describe the results of our field trial of {EatWell}, specifically characterizing how our participants were able to craft stories that were both emotive and culturally-relevant, the challenges that arose in creating these memories and finally how sharing these stories facilitated a sense of community empowerment. We conclude by presenting implications for the design of future applications that facilitate the sharing of health-related experiences.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Meta-analyses of behavior change {(BC)} interventions typically find large heterogeneity in effectiveness and small effects. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of active {BC} interventions designed to promote physical activity and healthy eating and investigate whether theoretically specified {BC} techniques improve outcome.


{DESIGN}

Interventions, evaluated in experimental or quasi-experimental studies, using behavioral and/or cognitive techniques to increase physical activity and healthy eating in adults, were systematically reviewed. Intervention content was reliably classified into 26 {BC} techniques and the effects of individual techniques, and of a theoretically derived combination of self-regulation techniques, were assessed using meta-regression.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Valid outcomes of physical activity and healthy eating.


{RESULTS}

The 122 evaluations {(N} = 44,747) produced an overall pooled effect size of 0.31 (95\% confidence interval = 0.26 to 0.36, I(2) = 69\%). The technique, "self-monitoring," explained the greatest amount of among-study heterogeneity (13\%). Interventions that combined self-monitoring with at least one other technique derived from control theory were significantly more effective than the other interventions (0.42 vs. 0.26).


{CONCLUSION}

Classifying interventions according to component techniques and theoretically derived technique combinations and conducting meta-regression enabled identification of effective components of interventions designed to increase physical activity and healthy eating.},

The studied groups of this research were 2 classes of 33 third graders; the two classes were separated into experimental and control group. The experiment was implemented in a four-week duration. The experimental group learned the knowledge of nutrition based on game playing on a national health e-learning network, whereas the control group was lectured with multi-media slide shows. During the learning process, the two groups underwent the steps of pretest, learning and posttest. The result revealed that students received better scores on nutrition knowledge test and dietary behavior assessments in the experimental group, which are evidence of the beneficial impact of health e-learning network's games on nutrition education and dietary behavior among elementary school students. This however, did not show much difference between the two groups in the assessment of nutrition attitude. Within the experimental group, the results did not differ much between the girls and boys in all three assessments.},

By contrast, when members were low in positive affect or self-monitoring they provided less emotional help to others, irrespective of the level of managerial responsibility.

Methods. We analyzed data from participants in the website condition of a randomized trial designed to test the efficacy of a print- vs. website-delivered intervention. They received four stage-targeted e-mails over 8 weeks, with hyperlinks to the website. Both objective and self-reported website use data were collected and analyzed.

Results. Overall, 327 were randomized to the website condition and 250 (76\%) completed the follow-up survey. Forty-six percent (n = 152) visited the website over the trial period. A total of 4,114 hits to the website were recorded. Participants who entered the site spent on average 9 min per visit and viewed 18 pages. Website use declined over time; 77\% of all visits followed the first e-mail.

Conclusions. Limited website engagement, despite the perceived usefulness of the materials, demonstrates possible constraints on the use of e-mails and websites in delivering health behavior change programs. In the often-cluttered information environment of workplaces, issues of engagement and retention in website-delivered programs require attention.},

It consists of a set of physiological sensors (heart rate and accelerometer) wirelessly connected to a mobile phone carried by the user. {MPTrain's} software allows the user to enter a desired workout in terms of desired heart rate stress over time. It then assists the user in achieving the desired exercising goals by: (1) constantly monitoring his/her physiology (heart rate in number of beats per minute) and movement (speed in number of steps per minute); and (2) selecting and playing music {(MP3s)} with specific features that will guide him/her towards achieving the desired workout goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel aspects of the {MPTrain} system and describe in detail our findings from a 9-week runner study, where participants ran with {MPTrain} for up to four 42-minute sessions. The runner study corroborated three hypotheses that we were interested in exploring: the {MPTrain} system (1) significantly improved the ability of runners to achieve the predefined workout goal, (2) made the experience more enjoyable and (3) increased the runners' perception of the workout's efficacy},

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Subjects. Overweight and obese {(Body} Mass Index {(BMI)} 25-40) participants without dietary restrictions. Intervention: Participants (n = 174) were randomized to record usual dietary intake using either {DietMatePro} or a paper food diary for one week to compare concordance with 24-hr recall. At the week 1 visit, participants were individually counseled to follow the diet recommendations of the Ornish Prevention Diet for three weeks and continue monitoring food intake using the assigned method to estimate adherence to the intervention by monitoring condition. Outcome Measures: Spearman correlations between week 1 24-hr recall and the assigned recording method were compared to assess validity. Mean pre-post changes in intake measured by 24-hr recall were compared according to monitoring condition to measure adherence to the Ornish diet. Results: Correlations of energy and nutrient values reported on the food label ranged from 0.41 to 0.71 for the {DietMatePro} condition versus 0.63 to 0.83 for the paper-based diary. Diet adherence was higher among {DietMatePro} (43\%) compared to the paper diary (28\%) group (p = 0.039). {Conclusions/Applications:} {DietMatePro} does not appear to produce more valid data than paper-based approaches. {DietMatePro} may improve adherence to dietary regimens compared to paper-based methods.},

The objective of this research is to evaluate the Healthy Weight Assistant {(HWA)} of the Netherlands Nutrition Centre and give recommendations for optimization of this application. This study consists of questionnaires (n=703, follow-up n=431), real-time usability-tests, log-file analysis and qualitative analysis. From the preliminary results we see that improvement with maximum effect and minimal change of the {HWA} can be found in motivation to keep using the application and motivation to change behavior. This can be achieved by sending automatic (tailored) reminders, restructuring the second stage in the application (motivation and goal setting) and by adding a tab 'my goals' to the application.},

	abstract = {Background
The Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)}, a measure of diet quality as specified by federal dietary guidance, was revised to conform to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. The {HEI} has several components, the scores of which are {totaled.Objective}
The validity and reliability of the {HEI-2005} were {evaluated.Design}
Validity was assessed by answering four questions: Does the {HEI-2005} 1) give maximum scores to menus developed by experts; 2) distinguish between groups with known differences in diet quality--smokers and nonsmokers; 3) measure diet quality independently of energy intake, a proxy for diet quantity; and 4) have more than one underlying dimension? The relevant type of reliability, internal consistency, was also {assessed.Subjects}
Twenty-four-hour recalls from 8,650 participants, aged 2 years and older, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002 were analyzed to answer questions 2 to 4. Results were weighted to consider sample design and {nonresponse.Statistical} analyses
T tests determined differences in scores between smokers and nonsmokers. Pearson correlation coefficients determined the relationship between energy intake and scores. Principal components analysis determined the number of factors that comprise the {HEI-2005.} Cronbach's coefficient [alpha] tested internal {consistency.Results}
{HEI-2005} scores are at or very near the maximum levels for all sets of exemplary menus with one exception; the Harvard menus scored low on the milk component because these menus intentionally include only small amounts of milk products. Nine of 12 component scores were lower for smokers than nonsmokers. The correlations of component scores were virtually independent of energy intake ({\textless} {\textbar}.22{\textbar}). Multiple factors underlie the {HEI-2005.} Coefficient [alpha] was .43. The [alpha] value for all tests was {.01.Conclusions}
The {HEI-2005} is a valid measure of diet quality. Potential uses include population monitoring, evaluation of interventions, and research. The individual component scores provide essential information in addition to that provided by the total score.},

One possibility, therefore, is that task performance can provide a measure of attention to dietary control. To explore this idea we measured performance on an otherwise irrelevant task during a meal. In two experiments, we compared intake and performance across five groups of females; dieters, and four groups of non-dieters, each with contrasting high and low scores on the restraint scale of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire and the disinhibition scale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Our analysis suggests that a correspondence can exist between task performance and intake {(Experiment} 1) and this might be influenced by the extent to which foods are regarded as forbidden {(Experiment} 2). However, aspects of our data are difficult to reconcile with the idea that task performance reflects a simple measure of attention to dietary control. Instead, one possibility is that individuals differ in the way that they choose to allocate attention during a meal. In relation to this idea, we discuss the possibility that some individuals choose to avoid food-related cognition by engaging strategically with other aspects of their cognitive environment.},

	abstract = {Background

Project {STRIDE} is a 4-year randomized controlled trial comparing two computer-based expert system guided intervention delivery channels (phone vs. print) for physical activity adoption and short-term maintenance among previously sedentary adults.
Methods

Sedentary adults (n = 239) were randomized to one of the following (1) telephone-based, individualized motivationally-tailored feedback; (2) print-based, individualized motivationally-tailored feedback; (3) contact-control delayed treatment group (received intervention after 12 months as control). This paper: (1) outlines the study design, rationale, and participant sample; and (2) describes relationships between baseline variables to better understand their influence on the efficacy of the intervention.
Results

Participants averaged 19.8 ± 25.0 min of physical activity/week that was at least of moderate intensity, with no group differences. The average estimated {VO2} at 85\% of maximum heart rate was 25.6 ml/kg/min. Body fat was 34.1\% for women and 23.2\% for men and the {BMI} of the sample averaged 28.5 kg/m2.
Conclusions

Project {STRIDE} examines non face-to-face approaches for promoting physical activity behavior. It has unique features including a direct comparison of an expert system guided intervention delivered via phone or print. Future analyses will examine the cost-effectiveness of the interventions and this will likely yield important information for policy-makers.},

In recent years, investigators have employed automated experience sampling to collect data to build predictive user models. To date, most procedures have relied on random sampling or simple heuristics. We perform a comparative analysis of several automated strategies for guiding experience sampling, spanning a spectrum of sophistication, from a random sampling procedure to increasingly sophisticated active learning. The more sophisticated methods take a decision-theoretic approach, centering on the computation of the expected value of information of a probe, weighing the cost of the short-term disruptiveness of probes with their benefits in enhancing the long-term performance of predictive models. We test the different approaches in a field study, focused on the task of learning predictive models of the cost of interruption.},

Constant comparative and matrix analysis procedures were used to analyze interview data; the qualitative results were then interfaced with descriptive numerical data on individuals' adherence to self-monitoring and weight loss. Three categories of self-monitoring experience were identified: (a) well-disciplined - those who had high adherence to self-monitoring, high weight loss, and a "can do" positive approach, (b) missing the connection - those who had moderate adherence, moderate- to low weight loss, and an "it's an assignment" approach, without integrating self-monitoring into everyday life, and (c) diminished support - those who had poor adherence, poor weight control, and were adversely affected by coexisting negative factors. Given the variations in how individuals integrated the process of self-monitoring, we need to consider individualizing self-monitoring strategies to improve adherence. © 2009 The Author(s).},

A key challenge is the pervasive deployment of {LBC} technologies; to be effective they must run on a wide variety of client platforms, including laptops, {PDAs}, and mobile phones, so that location data can be acquired anywhere and accessed by any application. Moreover, as a nascent area, {LBC} is experiencing rapid innovation in sensing technologies, the positioning algorithms themselves, and the applications they support. Lastly, as a newcomer, {LBC} must integrate with existing communications and application technologies, including web browsers and location data interchange {standard.This} paper describes our experience in developing the Place Lab architecture, a widely used first-generation open source toolkit for client-side location sensing. Using a layered, pattern-based architecture, it supports modular development in any dimension of {LBC}, enabling the field to move forward more rapidly as these innovations are shared with the community as pluggable components. Our experience shows the benefits of domain-specific abstractions, and how we overcame high-level language constraints to support a wide array of platforms in this emerging space. We also describe our experience in re-engineering parts of the architecture based on the needs of the user community, including insights on software licensing issues.},

	abstract = {A diary is generally considered to be a book in which one keeps a regular record of events and experiences that have some personal significance. As such, it provides a useful means to privately express inner thoughts or to reflect on daily experiences, helping in either case to put them in perspective. Taking conventional diary keeping as our starting point, we have designed and built a digital diary, named Affective Diary, with which users can scribble their notes, but that also allows for bodily memorabilia to be recorded from body sensors and mobile media to be collected from users' mobile phones. A premise that underlies the presented work is one that views our bodily experiences as integral to how we come to interpret and thus make sense of the world. We present our investigations into this design space in three related lines of inquiry: (1) a theoretical grounding for affect and bodily experiences; (2) a user-centred design process, arriving at the Affective Diary system; and (3) an exploratory end-user study of the Affective Diary with 4 users during several weeks of use. Through these three inquiries, our overall aim has been to explore the potential of a system that interleaves the physical and cultural features of our embodied experiences and to further examine what media-specific qualities such a design might incorporate. Concerning the media-specific qualities, the key appears to be to find a suitable balance where a system does not dictate what should be interpreted and, at the same time, lends itself to enabling the user to participate in the interpretive act. In the exploratory end-user study users, for the most part, were able to identify with the body memorabilia and together with the mobile data, it enabled them to remember and reflect on their past. Two of our subjects went even further and found patterns in their own bodily reactions that caused them to learn something about themselves and even attempt to alter their own behaviours.},

To determine the best provider and the most effective format for a nutrition intervention targeting patients with low literacy skills, we conducted interviews with literacy experts and health care providers and focus groups with members of adult basic education classes. Thirty-five literacy experts and health-center-based physicians, nurses, and nutritionists in Boston, Mass, were interviewed. In addition, 50 volunteer clients from 4 Boston-based adult basic education programs participated in 6 focus groups. Results suggested that health care providers consider nutrition to be a fundamental health education topic, but that its successful inculcation in patients with limited literacy skills is hindered mostly by insufficient provider time. Almost all providers agreed that patients need to be referred to nutritionists for nutrition education. Although most providers and patients acknowledged that patients perceive physicians to be the authorities on health, patients with low literacy skills turned first to family members and friends for health information. These results suggest that effective nutrition interventions must build on patients' social networks; appear in a visually based, interactive format; and be culturally appropriate.

Yet there is a growing body of research suggesting that people's decisions can often be better described by simple heuristics--rules of thumb that people use to make choices based on only a few important pieces of information. To test empirically whether a simple heuristic is able to account for individual food decisions, we ran a computerized experiment in which participants {(N=50)} repeatedly chose between pairs of 20 lunch dishes that were sampled from a local food court. A questionnaire assessed individual importance weights as well as evaluation ratings of each lunch dish on nine different factors. Our results show that a simple lexicographic heuristic that only considers each participant's most important factors is as good at predicting participants' food choices as a weighted additive model that takes all factors into account. This result questions the adequacy of weighted additive models as sole descriptions of human decision making in the food domain and provides evidence that food choices may instead be based on simple heuristics.},

Currently, however, there are only few successful applications of context-adapted {HCI}, arguably because use scenarios have not been based on holistic understanding of the society, users, and use situations. A humanistic research strategy, utilized at the Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, aims to structure the innovation and evaluation of scenarios for future technologies. Population trends and motivational needs are analyzed to recognize psycho-socially relevant design opportunities. Ethnography, ethnomethodology, bodystorming, and computer simulations of use situations are conducted to understand use situations. The goal of design is to empower users by supporting their autonomy and control. Three design cases illustrate the approach. The paper showcases an emerging framework for informed innovation of use potentials.},

	abstract = {A sedentary lifestyle is a contributing factor to chronic diseases, and it is often correlated with obesity. To promote an
increase in physical activity, we created a social computer game, {Fish’n’Steps}, which links a player’s daily foot step count
to the growth and activity of an animated virtual character, a fish in a fish tank. As further encouragement, some of the
players’ fish tanks included other players’ fish, thereby creating an environment of both cooperation and competition. In
a fourteen-week study with nineteen participants, the game served as a catalyst for promoting exercise and for improving game
players’ attitudes towards physical activity. Furthermore, although most player’s enthusiasm in the game decreased after the
game’s first two weeks, analyzing the results using Prochaska’s Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change suggests that
individuals had, by that time, established new routines that led to healthier patterns of physical activity in their daily
lives. Lessons learned from this study underscore the value of such games to encourage rather than provide negative reinforcement,
especially when individuals are not meeting their own expectations, to foster long-term behavioral change.},

The original {FCQ} appears to represent a comprehensive and reliable research instrument. However, the empirical data do not support the robustness of its 9-factorial design. On the other hand, segmentation results at the subpopulation level based on the enhanced {FCQ} version bring about an optimistic message for the {FCQ's} ability to predict food selection behaviour. The paper concludes that some of the basic components of the original {FCQ} can be used as a basis for a new general food motivation typology. The development of such a new instrument, with fewer, of higher abstraction {FCQ-based} dimensions and fewer items per dimension, is a right step forward; yet such a step should be theory-driven, while a rigorous statistical testing across and within population would be necessary.},

Verbatim transcripts of the interviews were analysed using qualitative methods that included constant comparison, concept mapping, and case summaries, and a conceptual food choice process model was developed. Data from the interviews are presented to illustrate the structure of this conceptual model. People's life course experiences affected major influences on food choice that included ideals, personal factors, resources, social contexts and the food context. These influences informed the development of personal systems for making food choices that incorporated value negotiations and behavioral strategies. Value negotiations weighed sensory perceptions, monetary considerations, health and nutrition beliefs and concerns, convenience, social relationships and quality of food choice decisions. Strategies employed to simplify the food choice process developed over time. The conceptual food choice process model represents the rich and complex bases of food practices, and provides a theoretical framework for research and practice in nutrition.},

	volume = {81},
	shorttitle = {Food-based dietary guidelines},
	abstract = {Recently, the concept of food-based dietary guidelines has been introduced by {WHO} and {FAO.} For this concept, several assumptions were necessary. The validity and potential consequences of some of these assumptions are discussed in this paper on the basis of the Dutch National Food Consumption Surveys. The topics were interrelationships among dietary characteristics, nutrient density, diets in accordance with the guidelines, and food variety. To obtain insight into overall diet quality, a dietary quality index based on nutrients and a food-based quality index based on food groups were created and tested. As expected the results showed that a higher dietary quality index was associated with an improved intake of the nutrients included in the index, in particular a lower intake of total fat and cholesterol. This was related to a lower consumption of cheese, fats and oils, meat and meat products, and a higher consumption of fruit and vegetables. The information obtained with a dietary quality index can be used to assess the feasibility of a particular goal in combination with other relevant goals and to obtain clues or confirmation for recommendations regarding food consumption. The food-based quality index created showed that a combination of several food-based goals (formulated in quantitative terms) was associated with an increase in food consumption, without a clear relevance for the dietary quality. Therefore, the formulation of food-based guidelines should be based on explicitly stated dietary goals. The findings regarding nutrient density were in the direction of what was assumed, namely a positive association between density and absolute intake, although the expected effects were not completely found. The results regarding the association between variety and dietary intake were characterized mainly by differences in quantity rather than dietary quality. The data indicate that energy intake may be an important pitfall in implementing food-based dietary guidelines, that 'eat a variety of food' can be an empty slogan and that nutrient density is positively related to the absolute intake of specific micronutrients. Further, the 'absence' of interrelationships among risk nutrients indicates that a selection process has to be applied.},

Typically, it is assumed that motives mediate the effect of traits on food intake. Motives may also have different effects on food intake, depending on trait level (moderation). Undergraduate students {(N�=�324)} completed the Food Involvement Scale and the Food Neophobia Scale measuring traits, and the Food Choice Questionnaire measuring specific motives. Daily food intake was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire two weeks later. General dietary healthfulness was based on its concordance with official recommendations. Regression analyses tested mediator and moderator relationships for each trait separately. The results partially support the mediation hypothesis: motives, such as Sensory Appeal and Health, mediated the effect of food involvement on intake of specific food categories. In addition, the relation of motives with both food intake and dietary healthfulness appeared to vary with level of food involvement or food neophobia (moderation). Implications to promote eating healthy food are discussed.},

Still, research demonstrates that 60-80\% of adults are not active at a level sufficient to derive health benefits {(Armstrong}, Bauman, \& Davies, 2000; Bowles, Morrow, Leonard, Hawkins, \& Couzelis, 2002; Pate et al., 1995), and working mothers may face particular challenges in pursuing physical activity and sport {(Jackson} \& Henderson, 1995). Utilizing the exercise psychology and women's leisure literatures, this study examines not only the barriers or constraints to participation, but also the ways that working mothers negotiate these barriers and, very practically, the ways that sport managers can better structure program offerings to increase access for this group {(Bauman}, Smith, Maibach, \& Reger-Nash, 2006; Jackson \& Henderson, 1995; Shaw, 1994). Forty-four working mothers from a university in the Southwestern United States participated in focus group inquiry regarding their physical activity and sport participation, barriers to participation, ways that they negotiated those barriers, and recommendations for change. Results indicated that rigid scheduling, guilt, and narrow programming constrained activity participation, and those constraints varied by marital status and social class. Negotiations included reframing entitlement to participation, garnering social support, and combating rigid work structures. Specific programming recommendations for sport managers as well as implications for social change are also discussed.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Estimate effectiveness of goal setting for nutrition and physical activity behavior change, review the effect of goal-setting characteristics on behavior change, and investigate effectiveness of interventions containing goal setting. {DATA} {SOURCE:} For this review, a literature search was conducted for the period January 1977 through December 2003 that included a Current Contents, Biosis Previews, Medline, {PubMed}, {PsycINFO}, and {ERIC} search of databases and a reference list search. Key words were goal, goal setting, nutrition, diet, dietary, physical activity, exercise, behavior change, interventions, and fitness. {STUDY} {INCLUSION} {AND} {EXCLUSION} {CRITERIA:} The search identified 144 studies, of which 28 met inclusion criteria for being published in a peer reviewed journal and using goal setting in an intervention to modify dietary or physical activity behaviors. Excluded from this review were those studies that (1) evaluated goal setting cross-sectionally without an intervention; (2) used goal setting for behavioral disorders, to improve academic achievement, or in sports performance; (3) were reviews. {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS:} The articles were categorized by target audience and secondarily by research focus. Data extracted included outcome measure, research rating, purpose, sample, sample description, assignment, findings, and goal-setting support. {RESULTS:} Thirteen of the 23 adult studies used a goal-setting effectiveness study design and eight produced positive results supporting goal setting. No adolescent or child studies used this design. The results were inconclusive for the studies investigating goal-setting characteristics (n = 7). Four adult and four child intervention evaluation studies showed positive outcomes. No studies reported power calculations, and only 32\% of the studies were rated as fully supporting goal setting. {CONCLUSIONS:} Goal setting has shown some promise in promoting dietary and physical activity behavior change among adults, but methodological issues still need to be resolved. The literature with adolescents and children is limited, and the authors are not aware of any published studies with this audience investigating the independent effect of goal setting on dietary or physical activity behavior. Although, goal setting is widely used with children and adolescents in nutrition interventions, its effectiveness has yet to be reported.},

English- and Spanish-speaking patients with diabetes had one in-person session and two telephone follow-up calls with a non-clinical provider over a 12-16-week period. At each call and at the end of the study, we assessed success in achieving behavioral goals and problem solving toward those goals. Satisfaction with the self-management guide was assessed at the end of the study. {RESULTS:} We enrolled 250 patients across three sites and 229 patients completed the study. Most patients chose to set goals in diet and exercise domains. 93\% of patients achieved at least one behavioral goal during the study and 73\% achieved at least two behavioral goals. Many patients exhibited problem solving behavior to achieve their goals. We found no significant differences in reported achievement of behavior goals by literacy or language. Patients were very satisfied with the guide. {CONCLUSIONS:} A brief goal setting intervention along with a diabetes self-management guide helped patients set and achieve healthy behavioral goals. {PRACTICE} {IMPLICATIONS:} Non-clinical providers can successfully help a diverse range of patients with diabetes set and achieve behavioral goals.},

This theory posits a multifaceted causal structure in which self-efficacy beliefs operate together with goals, outcome expectations, and perceived environmental impediments and facilitators in the regulation of human motivation, behavior, and well-being. Belief in one's efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change--whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved. Human health is a social matter, not just an individual one. A comprehensive approach to health promotion also requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread effects on human health.},

Monitoring nutritional intake can provide the stimulus to change unhealthy patterns. To this end we introduce Health View, a web-based nutrition monitoring system that subtly integrates with the current habits of today's young adults. Health View leverages already-existing grocery store savings card accounts to pull the necessary data into the system automatically. By managing grocery lists and providing a repository for recipes, Health View enables the conditions for monitoring the nutrition of users while they go about their usual tasks. When the current nutrition status is known, Health View can then make simple suggestions for improving the consumption habits of the users.},

	abstract = {The scientific community has long been interested in the overall quality of diets owing to the fact that it is important for each individual's health through a healthy, varied, and balanced diet. Much research has been conducted on methods used to measure dietary quality. These studies led to the determination of numerous indices, some very simple and some much more complex. Indices that examine diets for several attributes concurrently are able to provide a measure of overall diet quality that is not possible when only single nutrients or food groups are examined. Using these indices, diet quality may be evaluated in relation to nutrient adequacy, compliance with dietary guidelines, or nutrition recommendations, association with risk of chronic diseases, or mortality, and used to assess interventions. However, there are several factors that should be taken into consideration for the design of an index, like the purpose of its use, as well as its simplicity in daily practice. The general purpose of an index is to synthesize a large amount of information into a single useful indicator. The purpose of this review was to present and to critically review the most commonly used dietary indices, and how they reflect various aspects of diet quality. The majority of these indices fail to recognize the various inter-relationships between their components, as well as their accuracy for estimating specific health outcomes. Thus, the development of weighted dietary indices that adequately assess a dietary pattern and its relationship to the burden of a disease is considered essential.},

Research in persuasive technologies and the associated usage of a computing system, device, or application intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior in a predetermined way is showing the potential to assist in improving healthy living, reduce the costs on the health care system, and allow the aged to maintain a more independent life. This article gives a deeper insight into the evolution of persuasive technologies and presents a framework that can guide a researcher or practitioner in comprehending more effectively the work being done in this novel research field. It also provides categories of domains within health care in which these technologies are used and surveys exemplars from published literature. The article's goal is to provide greater understanding by addressing the challenges that lie ahead for all key stakeholders that design and/or use persuasive technologies in health care.},

Yet, how such technologies should be evaluated within the context of {HCI} research remains unclear. In this paper, we argue that the obvious answer to this question - that evaluations should assess whether a technology brought about the intended change in behavior - is too limited. We propose that demonstrating behavior change is often infeasible as well as unnecessary for a meaningful contribution to {HCI} research, especially when in the early stages of design or when evaluating novel technologies. As an alternative, we suggest that {HCI} contributions should focus on efficacy evaluations that are tailored to the specific behavior-change intervention strategies (e.g., self-monitoring, conditioning) embodied in the system and studies that help gain a deep understanding of people's experiences with the technology.},

Reviews were used to extract data at a study level. A taxonomy was used to classify behaviour change techniques. We included 23 systematic reviews: 14 on smoking cessation, 6 on physical exercise, and 2 on healthy diets and 1 on both exercise and diets. None of the behaviour change techniques demonstrated clear effects in a convincing majority of the studies in which they were evaluated. Techniques targeting knowledge (n = 210 studies) and facilitation of behaviour (n = 172) were evaluated most frequently. However, self-monitoring of behaviour (positive effects in 56\% of the studies), risk communication (52\%) and use of social support (50\%) were most often identified as effective. Insufficient insight into appropriateness of technique choice and quality of technique delivery hinder precise conclusions. Relatively, however, self-monitoring of behaviour, risk communication and use of social support are most effective. Health professionals should avoid thinking that providing knowledge, materials and professional support will be sufficient for patients to accomplish change and consider alternative strategies which may be more effective.},

One possibility is a hybrid of printed and electronic media that personalises messages according to the user's wishes. In the {TIVIK} project, {VTT} developed a technology that reads printed barcodes by mobile phone camera. The barcodes are used to provide product-specific information about the issues on priorities defined by the user. The system was tested for 2–3 weeks with 75 participants interested in weight management. For this group, reading the barcode gave the energy per portion for that product, also as a proportion of daily energy requirement estimated for the individual user. Users’ expectations of the system were high, implying that this kind of service is attractive. Willingness to use the system declined during the trial but was still considerable at the end of the period. In interview after the trial, rewarding features identified included feedback on one's own choices and improved understanding of the role of different products in energy intake. However, slow transfer of data and the limited number of products in the database were mentioned as problems. Utilising information technology to provide food-related information will open up new ways to develop personalised and sophisticated systems for both health services and marketing.},

The program needs to appropriately balance the level of detail used with the burden load on respondents and errors associated with categorisation of foods into groups. Various statistical techniques were utilised to aggregate a large number of food items into compositionally and conceptually similar groups. Exploratory statistical analysis, cluster analysis, stepwise regression analysis and association rule analysis were performed. A database containing 433 food groups was created which minimised the level of database error in the resulting data collection. Although some database error was introduced by aggregating food items into groups, the magnitude of the errors was reasonable considering other error sources. These findings are useful when applied to collection of food intake information for an individual's diet history and measurement of energy and macronutrient intake.},

	abstract = {Emerging Smart phones are poised to give a whole new dimension to the way we shop, bank, and go about many of our everyday activities. {iGrocer} is a smart grocery shopping assistant, that re-defines grocery shopping. It is capable of maintaining nutrition profiles of its users. Particularly useful for elders and disabled shoppers, {iGrocer} can aid and advice users on what products to buy and what to avoid based on nutrition criteria and price constraints. Implemented on a smart phone with a barcode scanner accessory, {iGrocer} has a number of killer features that include: (1) ubiquitous shopping list: adding items to the shopping list by different means (e.g. simply scanning them when near empty, scanning and storing manufacturer coupons, planning the weekly menu right on the phone or through the web, and shopping for the necessary ingredient of a particular recipe, (2) quick and assisted in-store shopping: while shopping in the grocery store, {iGrocer} maps out the shortest shopping path with a map indicating the location of the next item on the list, and (3)automated check-out: {iGrocer} is capable of acting on behalf of the store and the customer to perform a trusted queue-less checkout. In this "application-oriented" paper, we present the {iGrocer} concept and give details of its architecture and implementation. We also summarize the lessons learnt throughout its development and testing phases.},

	abstract = {The Women's Intervention Nutrition Study is a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate if a lifestyle intervention targeting fat intake reduction influences breast cancer recurrence in women with early stage, resected disease receiving conventional cancer management. This report details the concept, content, and implementation of the low-fat eating plan used in the dietary intervention group of this trial. Intervention group participants were given a daily fat gram goal. The intervention was delivered by centrally trained, registered dietitians who applied behavioral, cognitive, and motivational counseling techniques. The low-fat eating plan was implemented in an intensive phase with eight biweekly (up to Month 4), individual counseling sessions followed by a maintenance phase {(Month} 5 up to and including Year 5) with registered dietitian visits every 3 months and optional monthly group sessions. Self-monitoring (daily fat gram counting and recording), goal setting, and motivational interviewing strategies were key components. Dietary fat intake was equivalent at baseline and consistently lower in the intervention compared with the control group at all time points (percent energy from fat at 60 months 23.2\%+/-8.4\% vs 31.2\%+/-8.9\%, respectively, P{\textless}0.0001) and was associated with mean 6.1 lb mean weight difference between groups {(P=0.005)} at 5 years (baseline and 5 years, respectively: control 160.0+/-35.0 and 161.7+/-32.8 lb; intervention 160.2+/-35.1 and 155.6+/-32.1 lb). Together with previously reported efficacy results, this information suggests that a lifestyle intervention that reduces dietary fat intake and is associated with modest weight loss may favorably influence breast cancer recurrence. The Women's Intervention Nutrition Study low-fat eating plan can serve as a model for implementing such a long-term dietary intervention in clinical practice.},

We developed and tested a real-time diet-monitoring and feedback system using hand-held computers. The goals were to increase diet self-monitoring, reduce the burden of monitoring food intake, and increase adherence to dietary goals within a clinical trial. {METHODS:} Participants were 33 women in the Diet Modification arm of the Women's Health Initiative {(WHI).} After using focus groups to determine system features, women used the Personal Digital Assistant {(PDA)-based} system for 1 month and received immediate and weekly tailored feedback. The process and outcomes were evaluated using real-time food records collected through the {PDAs;} surveys; and self-reported food frequency questionnaires. {RESULTS:} Participants significantly increased self-monitoring, improved their attitudes toward self-monitoring, and met their dietary goals more often. Reported total fat intake and percent energy from fat decreased significantly. There was a modest decrease in mean caloric intake. {DISCUSSION:} The pilot study findings support the largely untapped potential of hand-held computers for improving diet monitoring and diet adherence, particularly within a clinical trial.},

	abstract = {Despite the need for effective obesity prevention strategies, little research has assessed adolescents' knowledge about basic concepts of energy intake, expenditure, and balance. Using data from 349 adolescent-caregiver pairs (recruited from {Minneapolis/St} Paul, {MN} metro region, 2006-2007), cross-sectional linear regression was used to assess adolescent and parental knowledge related to energy intake and expenditure as a predictor of adolescent weight-related behaviors and outcomes. Findings indicated that knowledge related to energy intake and expenditure was highly variable, with a substantial proportion of participants (particularly adolescents) lacking knowledge on a range of concepts. Adolescent knowledge was positively associated with moderate physical activity and negatively associated with television viewing {(P{\textless}0.05)}, but it was not associated with sweetened beverage consumption, fast food intake, weight status, and/or body composition. Although overall parental knowledge was a significant predictor of adolescent knowledge {(P{\textless}0.01)}, parent-child agreement on individual items was poor. As adolescents age, low literacy in this area may set the stage for poor decision-making related to energy balance and healthy weight maintenance. However, in that knowledge was not a significant predictor of various weight-related outcomes, these and other findings suggest that purely education-based health promotion strategies are insufficient to initiate long-term healthful behavior change. Educational strategies may be effective when combined with those also targeting familial, social, and environmental influences. The examination of interactive effects between individual-level and environmental influences on health behavior is an important area for future obesity-related research.},

	abstract = {Abstract
Background.
The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of an intervention designed to increase the availability of fruits, vegetables and lower fat foods in homes and schools. This research is part of the {TEENS} study, a school-based intervention study.
Methods.

Sixteen schools in Minnesota were recruited to be in the study, and approximately 3600 middle school students in the eight intervention schools were exposed to a multi-component intervention. The {TEENS} intervention included classroom-based curricula, family newsletters, and changes in the school food environment including increasing more healthful options on a la carte and on the school lunch line. In addition to student-level outcomes, changes in availability of fruits, vegetables, and lower fat snacks in home and school environments were evaluated. The {TEENS} study was conducted from 1997 to 2000.
Results.

Parents of students in intervention schools reported making healthier choices when grocery shopping as compared to parents of students in control schools {(P} = 0.01). No intervention effects were evident from a home food inventory. Compared to control schools, intervention schools offered {(P} = 0.04) and sold {(P} = 0.07) a higher proportion of healthier foods on a la carte, but no effects were seen for fruit and vegetables sales as part of the regular meal pattern lunch.
Conclusion.

Our results show mixed results for positively influencing adolescents' school and home environments.},

	abstract = {Of the 10 leading causes of death in the {US}, 6 are related to diet. Unfortunately, methods for real-time assessment and proactive health management of diet do not currently exist. There are only minimally successful tools for historical anal- ysis of diet and food consumption available. In this paper, we present an integrated database system that provides a unique perspective on how dietary assessment can be accomplished. We have designed three interconnected databases: an image database that contains data generated by food images, an ex- periments database that contains data related to nutritional studies and results from the image analysis, and finally an enhanced version of a nutritional database by including both nutritional and visual descriptions of each food. We believe that these databases provide tools to the healthcare commu- nity and can be used for data mining to extract diet patterns of individuals and/or entire social groups.},

The challenge for many of these systems is to increase initial adoption and sustain participation for sufficient time to have real impact on the life of its users. In this work we present some preliminary investigation into the design of a recipe recommender, aimed at educating and sustaining user participation, which makes tailored recommendations of healthy recipes. We concentrate on the two initial dimensions of food recommendations: data capture and food-recipe relationships and present a study into the suitability of varying recommender algorithms for the recommendation of recipes.},

Such technologies are explored today for example in mobile mapping systems, vehicle navigation systems and mobile robot navigation. Next-generation {LBS} also need theoretically sound methods to translate position into location information. The article addresses this problem: the transformation of position into meaningful and reliable location, and the transformation of location knowledge into positioning constraints. It suggests by this way an intelligent location model that integrates sensor fusion with spatial knowledge fusion via a feedback cycle. It is shown that this feedback cycle consists of three layers: spatial constraints, temporal constraints and spatiotemporal constraints. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

Therefore, developing healthy and balanced eating habits is important for most people to stay away from diseases. This study proposes an intelligent healthy diet planning multi-agent {(IHDPMA)}, including a personal profile agent, a nutrition facts analysis agent, a knowledge analysis agent, a discovery agent, a fuzzy inference agent, and a semantic generation agent for healthy diet planning. The {IHDPMA} provides a semantic analysis of healthy diet status for people based on the pre-constructed ontology by domains experts and results of fuzzy inference. With the generated semantic analysis, people can get healthy information about what they eat and make it easier to eat a balanced and healthy diet. The experimental platform has been constructed to test the performance of the {IHDPMA.} The results indicate that the {IHDPMA} can effectively work for healthy diet planning.},

Likewise, for proactive health care, such as nutrition or fitness, or post diagnosis support, to find fellow-sufferers, we turn to online resources. There is, it seems, a potential disconnect between points at which professional and proactive health care intersect. Such gaps in information sharing may have direct impact on practices we decide to take up, the care we seek, and the support professionals offer. In this panel, we consider several places within proactive, preventative health care in particular {HCI} has a role towards enhancing health knowledge discovery and health support interaction.

The Re-source Competition Framework {(RCF)}, building on the Multiple Resources Theory, explains how psychosocial tasks typical of mobile situations compete for cognitive resources and then suggests that this leads to the depletion of resources for task interaction and eventually results in the breakdown of fluent interaction. {RCF} predictions were tested in a semi-naturalistic field study measuring attention during the performance of assigned Web search tasks on mobile phone while moving through nine varied but typical urban situations. Notably, we discovered up to eight-fold differentials between micro-level measurements of atten-tional resource fragmentation, for example from spans of over 16 seconds in a laboratory condition dropping to bursts of just a few seconds in difficult mobile situations. By cali-brating perceptual sampling, reducing resources from tasks of secondary importance, and resisting the impulse to switch tasks before finalization, participants compensated for the resource depletion. The findings are compared to previous studies in office contexts. The work is valuable in many areas of {HCI} dealing with mobility.},

	abstract = {Small displays are currently gaining importance as interfaces for geographic information. More specifically, mobile position-aware devices, such as mobile phones equipped with globally positioning system, are increasingly used for mobile wayfinding assistance. But their constrained displays are too small to reproduce conventional maps without an increasing effort for the user. For example, they have to zoom in and out, and to scroll through the map to understand the details and configurational relationships of the involved entities of a route. This fragmentation of the information is not just inconvenient, but actually affects the cognitive processing of the given information and lowers the effectiveness of the assistance. One way to attack this problem is to tailor maps to the individual knowledge of a user. If an assistance system knows about the places and paths a user knows, it can generate maps according to this information: those parts of a route, which the user has good knowledge of, can be displayed with less detail and parts with no or little knowledge can be emphasised. However, the transformation of maps with respect to previous knowledge is a yet unexplored field and requires new and basic considerations about map generation. In this work, we analyse prototypical spatial configurations, geographic veridicality and assistance scenarios. We demonstrate first prototypes of personalised maps for small display cartography. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

We present {LiveCompare}, a system that leverages the ubiquity of mobile camera phones to allow for grocery bargain hunting through participatory sensing. We utilize two-dimensional barcode decoding to automatically identify grocery products, as well as localization techniques to automatically pinpoint store locations. We show that an incentive scheme is inherently ingrained into our query/response protocol, and we suggest self-regulating mechanisms for preserving data integrity. As a result, we demonstrate that money-saving price comparisons can be conducted among brick and mortar grocery stores without the explicit cooperation of the stores.},

	abstract = {Many applications in the area of location-based services and personal navigation require nowadays the location determination of a user not only in an outdoor environment but also an indoor. Typical applications of location-based services {(LBS)} mainly in outdoor environments are fleet management, travel aids, location identification, emergency services and vehicle navigation. {LBS} applications can be further extended if reliable and reasonably accurate three-dimensional positional information of a mobile device can be determined seamlessly in both indoor and outdoor environments. Current geolocation methods for {LBS} may be classified as {GNSS-based}, cellular network-based or their combinations. {GNSS-based} methods rely very much on the satellite visibility and the receiver-satellite geometry. This can be very problematic in dense high-rise urban environments and when transferring to an indoor environment. Especially, in cities with many high-rise buildings, the urban canyon will greatly affect the reception of the {GNSS} signals. Moreover, positioning in the indoor/outdoor transition areas would experience signal quality and signal reception problems, if {GNSS} systems alone are employed. The authors have proposed the integration of {GNSS} with wireless positioning techniques such as {WiFi} and {UWB.} In the case of {WiFi} positioning, the so-called fingerprinting method based on {WiFi} signal strength observations is usually employed. In this article, the underlying technology is briefly reviewed, followed by an investigation of two {WiFi-positioning} systems. Testing of the system is performed in two localisation test beds, one at the Vienna University of Technology and another one at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The first test showed that the trajectory of a moving user could be obtained with a standard deviation of about ±3-5 m. The main disadvantage of {WiFi} fingerprinting, however, is the required time consuming and costly signal strength system calibration in... {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

This systematic review aims to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of physical activity interventions targeted at healthy adults and to identify effective intervention {components.Methods}
The systematic search in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Psycinfo identified literature published in English and German between January 2001 and June 2007. We included randomised controlled trials investigating physical activity interventions for healthy adults with a minimum study duration of 12 months. Two researchers independently assessed publications according to pre-defined inclusion criteria and methodological quality was rated according to the {SIGN} criteria. Study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted, and pooled effect estimates with 95\% confidence intervals {calculated.Results}
Of 5508 identified publications 25 studies met the inclusion criteria. There was substantial heterogeneity in study quality, intervention strategies and intervention effects. Compared to no-intervention and minimal-intervention control, gains in weekly energy expenditure and physical fitness of up to 975 kcal and 11\% were achieved, respectively. Booster interventions were used in 16 {studies.Conclusions}
There is evidence for long-term increases in physical activity behaviour and physical fitness. To improve uptake of physical activity additional tailored exercise prescription strategies seem promising. Booster interventions such as phone, mail or internet can help to facilitate long-term effectiveness.},

(2) Having selected and implemented the most prototypic ideas their potential was evaluated in the second step using the matching and the naming method. (3) In the third step an icon-based menu was constructed, programmed and implemented. (4) Finally, the utility of this prototype vis-a-vis a text-based menu was investigated on an experimental basis in a menu search task. The icon- based menu is shown to produce a significantly higher learnability thus outweighing initial differences. In general, results demonstrate that icon-based menus are basically viable and successfully applicable, if a users-centered procedure is pursued and if icons represent prototypical semantic knowledge.},

Analyses involved bivariate and multivariate statistical tests. Relationships were stronger when limited to diet or physical activity outcomes as opposed to body mass index or waist circumference. Diet-related strategies were more strongly correlated with diet-related outcomes than physical activity-related outcomes and vice versa. Measures of social interactions and self-monitoring for both diet and physical activity were consistently related to outcomes. The measures show promise as reliable and valid indicators of behavior that could be useful in the evaluation of interventions.

Methods: Twenty-five physical activity intervention studies and 45 physical activity correlational studies were found in the literature, tabulated, and included in the analysis.
Results: Behavioral interventions for promoting physical activity have worked primarily when participants were motivated enough to volunteer or when a school-based physical education program changed. In most cases, behavioral or psychosocial theory accounted for 30\% or less of the variability in physical activity behaviors. Most intervention studies do not measure mediating variables, and when they do, they do not systematically effect changes in all the mediating variables on which they are predicated.
Discussion: To increase the effectiveness of physical activity interventions, more physical activity research should focus on a better understanding of the predictors of physical activity and toward interventions demonstrated to effect change in these predictors of physical activity.
Conclusion: Changing the focus to basic behavioral and social science and mediator change research should provide a more systematic and cost-effective approach to increasing the effectiveness of physical activity interventions.},

A moderate indirect effect of print (0.39, 95\% {CI} = 0.21, 0.57) was found due to increases in behavioral processes (0.54, 95\% {CI} = 0.29, 0.80) being attenuated by decreases due to cognitive processes (-0.17, {95\%CI} = -0.31,-.03).

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1) is designed to provide science-based diet and physical activity recommendations for promoting health and reducing risk of chronic disease. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that following a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines may reduce the risk of chronic disease (2). Yet, adherence to the Dietary Guidelines and other public health recommendations is low among the {US} population. Estimates suggest as few as 3\% to 4\% of Americans follow all of the Dietary Guidelines recommendations ( [3] and [4]). Food consumption data indicates that consumers must make considerable changes to reach {MyPyramid} goals for solid fats, sugar, the five primary food groups, and the subgroups ( [1] and [5]). Furthermore, intake levels of certain shortfall nutrients are low enough to be of concern for adults, including calcium; potassium; fiber; magnesium; and vitamins A, C, and E (1).

Possible reasons why the Dietary Guidelines and {MyPyramid} Food Guidance System have had a negligible influence on changing dietary behaviors have been proposed (3). These include consumer confusion with the ongoing delivery of sometimes conflicting dietary information, advice that is not adequately individualized to address personal health concerns, and failure to integrate experimental evidence with real-life situations.

Consumer-based research has been conducted to better understand how to successfully communicate concepts from the Dietary Guidelines ( [6], [7] and [8]). A key finding from qualitative research is that consumers want realistic and personalized guidance to help them adopt more healthful eating habits ( [8] and [9]). Consumers say they are looking for practical, motivating, and easy-to-implement strategies that emphasize small steps vs major life changes (9). A national obesity prevention campaign launched in March 2004 by the {US} Department of Health and Human Services is aimed at improving health through diet and physical activity by helping consumers take it one small step at a time (10). The small steps approach has become a popular strategy for encouraging consumers to make gradual changes to meet dietary and physical activity goals. For example, {MyPyramid's} {slogan—Steps} to a Healthier You—suggests that consumers can benefit from taking small steps each day to improve their diet and lifestyle.

Food intake pattern modeling is a method for evaluating nutrient adequacy of proposed food intake patterns and assessing possible effects of recommended changes in food selection for various groups of people (11). It can be used to appraise new nutrient recommendations and determine the need for compensating changes in overall dietary recommendations. Various modeling exercises were performed to develop and evaluate the {MyPyramid} food patterns and determine the effects of potential Dietary Guidelines recommendations on overall dietary adequacy (11).

Menu modeling, a similar technique, was used in our analysis to evaluate actual and recommended food intake patterns using specific foods readily available in supermarkets, including canned, frozen, and convenience products. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the incremental changes in diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)-2005}, when baseline menus were modified with gradual changes through a series of transitional menus to meet the food and nutrient recommendations of {MyPyramid} and the Dietary Guidelines.

The {HEI-2005} is designed to assess diet quality by measuring compliance of diets with the key, diet-related recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines (12). It is designed for use in nutrition monitoring, evaluation of nutrition interventions, nutrition education, and research (13). The 12 components of the {HEI-2005} include nine adequacy components: the five major food groups plus oils found in {MyPyramid} and three subgroup recommendations (ie, whole fruits, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, and whole grains). Three moderation components include saturated fat, sodium, and energy from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars. Unlike the previous {HEI}, the {HEI-2005} assesses dietary intakes on a per kilocalorie basis rather than absolute amounts of food consumed; thus, the {HEI-2005} score represents quality of the relative proportions of foods consumed. Component scores are assigned based on how close the diet comes to meeting goals for each of the 12 components. Standards for scoring are described elsewhere (12). The {HEI-2005} was applied to national dietary intake surveys conducted in 1994-96 and in 2001-02 to assess diet quality of Americans before implementation of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines (14). The component scores were below the maximum score possible for all components with the exception of total grains and meat and beans. The overall diet quality changed little between this time period with a consistent score of 58 out of 100 possible, indicating that the diet quality of Americans needs improvement (14). The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion plans to include the {HEI-2005} in a future update of {MyPyramid} Tracker, the Center's dietary assessment and nutrition education tool.

Results of this menu modeling analysis were instrumental in supporting a national in-store nutrition campaign developed by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Food Marketing Institute, and {MatchPoint} Marketing called Take a Peak into {MyPyramid} (15). Introduced in January 2007, this effort by food manufacturers and retailers to support the 2005 Dietary Guidelines disseminates the nutrition messages of {MyPyramid} at the retail level and identifies foods in grocery stores that provide a meaningful contribution toward meeting the food and nutrient goals of {MyPyramid.}},

Phones can be envisioned as people-centric sensors capable of aggregating participatory as well as sensory inputs from local surroundings. The inputs can be visualized in different dimensions, such as space and time. When plugged into the Internet, the collaborative inputs from phones may enable a high resolution view of the world. This paper presents the architecture and implementation of one such system, called Micro-Blog. New kinds of application-driven challenges are identified and addressed in the context of this system. Implemented on Nokia N95 mobile phones, Micro-Blog was distributed to volunteers for real life use. Promising feedback suggests that Micro-Blog can be a deployable tool for sharing, browsing, and querying global information.},

	abstract = {In order to assess nutritional adequacy, valid estimates of nutrient intake are required. One of the main errors in dietary assessment is misreporting. The objective was to review the extent, nature and determinants of misreporting in dietary assessment, how this affects reported intakes of micronutrients and how this is identified and measured, and to identify the best ways of dealing with misreporting when interpreting results. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of misreporting of dietary intake in adults by 24 hour recalls or by estimated or weighed food records, published up to March 2008. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified. Possible causes of misreporting were identified. Methods most used to identify misreporting were the Goldberg cut-off (46 \% studies) and the doubly labelled water technique (24 \% studies). The magnitude of misreporting of energy intake was similar in all three dietary assessment methods. The percentage of under-reporters was about 30 \% and energy intake was underestimated by approximately 15 \%. Seven papers presented usable data for micronutrient intake. Absolute intakes of Fe, Ca and vitamin C (the three micronutrients addressed in all papers) were on average 30 \% lower in low-energy reporters {(LER)} than that in non-{LER} and, although results were not consistent, there was a tendency for micronutrient density to be higher in {LER.} Excluding underreporters or using energy adjustment methods for micronutrient intakes is discussed. Residual method of energy adjustment seems to be a good tool for practice to decrease an influence of misreporting when interpreting results of studies based on food records and 24 hour recalls.},

Four hundred and thirty-three subjects (47\%) successfully completed their weight control programme. There were mean reductions of weight, waist circumference and body mass index of 1.6 kg {(P{\textless}0.001)}, 4.3 cm {(P{\textless}0.001)} and 0.6 kg/m(2) {(P{\textless}} 0.001), respectively.

Mixed dishes, being a mixture of components with varying proportions, prove problematic for categorising and reporting consumption--unlike basic foods, which can be classified into specific food groups relatively easily. For both purchased and homemade mixed dishes, it is advantageous to have a consistent method for assigning dishes to appropriate food groups, while retaining continuity with previous {NDNS} surveys to enable investigation of trends over time. Historically two main methods have been used to classify mixed dishes in the {NDNS} databank: either grouping by meat or fish content, or grouping by the main food component. Neither method is entirely satisfactory. In this study, selected foods were tabulated by both methods to determine which approach should be used in future work. Neither method proved entirely satisfactory alone, and in order to maintain consistency and continuity for the main survey of the new {NDNS} rolling programme, it was decided to take into account elements from both methods and to place comparable recipes together in the same food groups. A varied approach encompassing food names, proportions of ingredients and case-by-case judgement is the most appropriate way to classify mixed food dishes in a nutrient databank.},

	abstract = {The obesity epidemic is one of the most rapidly evolving public health problems of our day. At present, 2/3 of American adults and 1/6 of American children and adolescents are considered either overweight or obese. Public health concern about obesity is high and reflects documented increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, many forms of cancer, gallbladder disease, and osteoarthritis, and increased mortality from these ailments, especially among the most obese. Innovative engineering technologies are needed to address a large range of problems in energy balance, intake, and expenditure that are associated with the obesity epidemic. Excess adipose tissue, representing fat storage, ultimately derives from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Novel sensors, devices, imaging technologies, nanotechnology, biomaterials, and other approaches need to be developed and evaluated through multidisciplinary collaborations between engineers, physical scientists, and scientists with expertise in obesity and nutrition. The goal is to encourage research to develop useful technologies and tools to facilitate research and eventually to support therapeutic advances and behavioral change. Furthermore, the possibility of re-engineering the "built environment" to encourage higher levels of physical activity has been suggested as another promising and important approach to which engineers can contribute (see http://www.obesityresearch.nih.gov).},

Through their actions of caring for their children, parents want to know they're doing the best job to ensure their children's well being. Unfortunately, much of the time this responsibility is a challenge-particularly for busy, dual-income parents-because it involves the collection, organization, retrieval, and transfer of information between many people in many different contexts. In our user research with dual-income parents they shared their experiences of forgetting to give medication, and of both not having an easy way of recording information and not having the information they needed when communicating with childcare and healthcare providers. Smart home technology appears to offer a promise to easy this situation for parents; however, the {HCI} community has only investigated healthcare in the home with a focus on elders. To better understand this opportunity area we conducted a user-centered design project looking at the management of children's by their parents.},

	abstract = {Background
Comprehension of food labels can be important for patients, including those with chronic illness, to help follow dietary recommendations. Patient comprehension of food labels was examined, along with the relationship of comprehension to their underlying literacy and numeracy {skills.Methods}
From June 2004 to April 2005, a cross-sectional study of 200 primary care patients was performed. A 24-item measure of food label comprehension was administered. Literacy was measured with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine {(REALM)}, and numeracy with the Wide Range Achievement Test, third edition {(WRAT-3).Results}
Most patients (89\%) reported using food labels. While 75\% of patients reported at least a high school education and 77\% had 9th-grade literacy skills, only 37\% had 9th-grade math skills. On average, patients answered 69\% (standard deviation, 21\%) of the food-label questions correctly. Common reasons for incorrect responses included misapplication of the serving size, confusion due to extraneous material on the food label, and incorrect calculations. For example, only 37\% of patients could calculate the number of carbohydrates consumed from a 20-ounce bottle of soda that contained 2.5 servings. Higher comprehension of food labels was significantly correlated (all p values were less than 0.001) with higher income (rho=0.39), education (rho=0.49), literacy (rho=0.52), and numeracy {(rho=0.67).Conclusions}
Patients demonstrated deficits in understanding nutrition labels. Poor label comprehension was highly correlated with low-level literacy and numeracy skills, but even patients with higher literacy could have difficulties interpreting labels. Providers need to consider patients' literacy and numeracy when providing dietary recommendations. Opportunities may exist for the {U.S.} Food and Drug Administration to promote changes to make food labels more comprehensible.},

To explore patients newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus {(T2DM)} experiences of making single (diet) or multiple (diet and physical activity) changes in order to (1) assess whether patients experienced increases in physical activity as supporting or hindering dietary changes and vice versa, and (2) whether patients found making multiple lifestyle changes counterproductive or {beneficial.Methods}
In-depth interviews with 30 individuals taking part in a randomised controlled trial that aimed to determine the effect of diet and physical activity on {T2DM.} Interviewees had been randomised to receive usual care, intensive dietary advice, or intensive dietary advice plus information on physical activity. Respondents were interviewed 6 and 9 months post-randomisation. They were asked about their experiences of making lifestyle changes. Data were analysed {thematically.Results}
Findings suggest providing diet and physical activity information together encourages patients to use physical activity in strategic ways to aid disease management and that most patients find undertaking multiple lifestyle changes {helpful.Conclusion}
Increasing physical activity can act as a gateway behaviour, i.e. behaviour that produces positive effects in other {behaviours.Practice} implications
Practitioners should provide diet and physical activity information together to encourage patients to use physical activity strategically to maintain dietary changes.},

For detection, the precision of sensing must be high enough to minimize annoying false notifications, despite the constraints imposed by the inaccuracy of commodity sensors and the limited battery power available on mobile phones. For reporting, the notifications cannot be too obtrusive to the user or those in the vicinity. Peripheral cues are appropriate for conveying information like proximity, but have been studied primarily in settings like offices where sensors and cueing mechanisms can be controlled.},

So far, the system does not make use of the corrections made by the users to improve the performance of classification. In this paper, we propose to incrementally update the classifier based on Baysian network so that the results of analysis will be improved by using the user's corrections.

Participants were aware of the weaknesses their family's dietary habits and were motivated to make changes, but lacked financial, strategic, and social resources needed to do so. Based on our analysis, the current trend of raising awareness and motivation to change does not appear to address the needs of this population.

Methods. Two-hundred and ten African-American girls completed the {GEMS} Activity Questionnaire {(GAQ)}, a checklist of 28 physical and 7 sedentary activities, including {TV} viewing, inquiring whether performed on the previous day (“yesterday”), and whether usually performed (“usual”). The girls wore an accelerometer (used as the criterion for validity) for three consecutive days at baseline and after a 12-week pilot intervention. Data from 172 girls at baseline and follow-up were usable for this report.

Results. Girls were (mean ± {SD)} 8.8 ± 0.8 years old with a {BMI} of 22.3 ± 5.9 kg/m2. The intraclass correlation {(ICC)} examining reliability for the accelerometer across 3 days at baseline for the combined group was fair {(ICC} = 0.33, P {\textless} 0.21). The test–retest reliability coefficient for the 18-item {MET-weighted} {GAQ} yesterday scores for the comparison group of girls was 0.57 {(P} {\textless} 0.001). At baseline and follow-up, nonsignificant correlations were observed between 3-day accelerometer counts/minute and {GAQ} 18-item usual score for both comparison and intervention groups. A significant correlation was found between change in accelerometer minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity {(MVPA)} between 12 noon and 6 {PM} and change in {GAQ} physical activities in the comparison girls {(R} = 0.35, P {\textless} 0.01). The {TV-usual} score was correlated with 3-day accelerometer counts/minute {(R} = −0.19, P = 0.02) at baseline for the total sample.

Conclusions. Correlations between the {GAQ} and accelerometer were low, indicating low validity. Although the {GAQ} may be helpful in describing types of physical activities performed, it needs further development to improve its psychometric properties.},

Overweight among children and adolescents was defined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index {(BMI)} for age growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a {BMI} of 30 or higher; extreme obesity was defined as a {BMI} of 40 or higher. Results In 2003-2004, 17.1\% of {US} children and adolescents were overweight and 32.2\% of adults were obese. Tests for trend were significant for male and female children and adolescents, indicating an increase in the prevalence of overweight in female children and adolescents from 13.8\% in 1999-2000 to 16.0\% in 2003-2004 and an increase in the prevalence of overweight in male children and adolescents from 14.0\% to 18.2\%. Among men, the prevalence of obesity increased significantly between 1999-2000 (27.5\%) and 2003-2004 (31.1\%). Among women, no significant increase in obesity was observed between 1999-2000 (33.4\%) and 2003-2004 (33.2\%). The prevalence of extreme obesity (body mass index [≥]40) in 2003-2004 was 2.8\% in men and 6.9\% in women. In 2003-2004, significant differences in obesity prevalence remained by race/ethnicity and by age. Approximately 30\% of non-Hispanic white adults were obese as were 45.0\% of non-Hispanic black adults and 36.8\% of Mexican Americans. Among adults aged 20 to 39 years, 28.5\% were obese while 36.8\% of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0\% of those aged 60 years or older were obese in 2003-2004. Conclusions The prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents and obesity among men increased significantly during the 6-year period from 1999 to 2004; among women, no overall increases in the prevalence of obesity were observed. These estimates were based on a 6-year period and suggest that the increases in body weight are continuing in men and in children and adolescents while they may be leveling off in women.},

Background

Mediated physical activity interventions can reach large numbers of people at low cost. Programs delivered through the mail that target the stage of motivational readiness have been shown to increase activity. Communication technology (websites and e-mail) might provide a means for delivering similar programs.
Methods

Randomized trial conducted between August and October 2001. Participants included staff at an Australian university (n=655; mean {AGE=43}, standard deviation, 10 years). Participants were randomized to either an 8-week, stage-targeted print program {(Print)} or 8-week, stage-targeted website {(Web)} program. The main outcome was change in self-reported physical activity.
Results

There was no significant increase in total reported physical activity within or between groups when analyzed by intention to treat {(F} [1,653]=0.41, p=0.52). There was a significant increase in total physical activity reported by the Print participants who were inactive at baseline (t [1,173]=−2.21, p=0.04), and a significant decrease in the average time spent sitting on a weekday in the Web group (t [1,326]=2.2, p=0.03).
Conclusions

There were no differences between the Print and Web program effects on reported physical activity. The Print group demonstrated slightly larger effects and a higher level of recognition of program materials.},

As the population ages, chronic diseases also become rampant, leading to mounting medical socio-economical burdens. Moreover, old people and patients are often confined to a relatively small space, so that their whereabouts can be tracked. The situation can be rectified with the ingenious combination of embedded information devices and mobile communication capability. We have implemented a system that embodies these technologies. It can take vital physiological data of a user and communicate the data together with location information to a backend server for processing and may trigger necessary actions. The process can take place anywhere, any time, and give great freedom to system users. We describe the system architecture, address practical implementation issues, and present some performance results.},

Background. Low levels of physical activity {(PA)} and highly sedentary leisure habits {(SLH)} in youth may establish behavioral patterns that will predispose youth to increased chronic disease risk in adulthood. The purpose of this paper was to examine associations of demographic and psychosocial factors with self-reported {PA} and {SLH} in young adolescents.

Methods. A general linear mixed model predicted self-reported {PA} and {SLH} in the spring from demographic and psychosocial variables measured the previous fall in 3798 seventh grade students.

Results. {PA} and {SLH} differed by race, with Caucasian students reporting among the highest {PA} and lowest {SLH.} Perceptions of higher academic rank or expectations predicted higher {PA} and lower {SLH.} Depressive symptomatology predicted higher {SLH} scores but not {PA.} Higher self-reported value of health, appearance, and achievement predicted higher {PA} and lower {SLH} in girls. Girls who reported that their mothers had an authoritative parenting style also reported higher {PA} and lower {SLH.}

Conclusions. Determinants of {PA} and {SLH} appear to differ from each other, particularly in boys. Development of effective programs to increase {PA} and/or decrease {SLH} in young adolescents should be based on a clear understanding of the determinants of these behaviors.},

Attitudes were a summation of beliefs about taste, different health consequences, and costs in time and money. Social influences were measured through the social stimulation respondents expected to get from important others to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables and by asking the subjects about the behaviour of important others. Self-efficacy reflected the respondents» ability to consume adequate amounts of fruit and vegetables in various situations. Self-efficacy and attitudes were consistently and significantly associated with consumption of boiled or otherwise heated vegetables, of salads, and of fruit. Furthermore, respondents reporting low consumption of these food groups had lower self-efficacy expectations and less positive attitudes than subjects with relatively high consumption of fruit and vegetables. It is concluded that nutrition education aimed at stimulating fruit and vegetable consumption should focus especially on changing attitudes and self efficacy expectations.},

	abstract = {Three of 4 Americans believe there is too much conflicting information about diet (1). Part of this confusion has to do with the amount of food considered to be a “serving” or a “portion.” Each person has his or her own perceptions of “standard” food portions.

Today's large portions, the norm in many eating establishments, can differ substantially from the 3 key standards for serving sizes: the Food Guide Pyramid (2), the Nutrition Facts Label on food packaging (3), and the Exchange Lists for Meal Planning (4). For example, one large deli bagel might weigh 4 oz, whereas the half bagel listed as a serving in the Food Guide Pyramid and the Exchange Lists weighs about 1 oz. Meanwhile, the serving size listed on the Nutrition Facts Label is 1 bagel (which may vary from 1 oz to more than 4 oz). With so much variation, it is no wonder that consumers are confused about what portions and serving sizes mean and how to use them.

Many factors affect how much people eat, including a person's age, gender, activity level, cultural background, and appetite, not to mention where and when food is obtained and eaten. Most people think of a portion as the amount of a specific food they eat at a meal or for a snack. For example, spaghetti served with meat sauce is often considered a single portion, regardless of the amount served. The large portions offered at restaurants and other food venues suggest to the public that the amount served is a standard portion. In fact, these portions are often 3 to 4 times larger than what is considered standard. For example, a 3-piece chicken dinner provides 3 meat portions; a large submarine sandwich may provide 4 standard bread portions plus other sandwich components.

Several researchers have documented how inaccurate people can be when asked to estimate food portion sizes (5), (6) and (7). When keeping food records, people list foods eaten but usually estimate rather than measure or weigh actual amounts consumed. Misestimations typically result in underreporting the amount of meat, fats, sweets, and alcohol consumed. Thus, nutrient intake calculated from such data often misrepresents actual energy intake and nutrients consumed. Tools such as the Food Guide Pyramid, Nutrition Facts Label, and Exchange Lists can help consumers understand food portions, provide more accurate data for assessment, and make more healthful food choices.},

We propose anonymizing a user by camouflaging their current location with various predicted paths. This is akin to increasing the noise floor around the user. We believe this different approach provides many advantages. By allowing the user to keep all desired functionality while still protecting the user's privacy, we enable use of a broader class of {LBSs.} To demonstrate our proposal, we develop {CacheCloak}, a system that enables realtime anonymization of continuous location updates without any loss of accuracy. Data from a {GIS-based} traffic simulation in an urban environment shows that {CacheCloak} can anonymize users rapidly.},

The resulting online recipe collections are repositories of ingredient combinations and cooking methods whose large-scale and variety yield interesting insights about both the fundamentals of cooking and user preferences. These insights include preferences for cooking methods depending on the nutritional value extracted from food, and the geographic region from which the recipe originates. At the level of an individual ingredient we measure whether it tends to be essential or can be dropped or added, and whether its quantity can be modified. We also construct two types of networks to capture the relationships between ingredients. The complement network captures which ingredients tend to co-occur frequently, and is composed of two large communities: one savory, the other sweet. The substitute network, derived from user generated suggestions for modifications, can be decomposed into many communities of functionally equivalent ingredients, and captures users' preference for healthier variants a recipe. Our experiments reveal that recipe ratings can be well predicted with features derived from combinations of ingredient networks and nutrition information.},

Automated and accurate food recognition presents the following challenges. First, there exist a large variety of food types that people consume in everyday life. Second, a single category of food may contain large variations due to different ways of preparation. Also, diverse lighting conditions may lead to varying visual appearance of foods. All of these pose a challenge to the state of the art recognition approaches. Moreover, the low quality images captured using cellphones make the task of {3D} reconstruction difficult. In this paper, we combine several vision techniques (visual recognition and {3D} reconstruction) to achieve quantitative food intake estimation. Evaluation of both recognition and reconstruction is provided in the experimental results.},

Other interactive systems including "serious games" have been applied for the same purpose in areas such as nutrition, health and energy conservation, but they suffer from drawbacks such as inaccurate self-reporting, burdens placed on the user, and lack of effective feedback. Ambient lifestyle feedback systems overcome these challenges by relying on passive observation, calm presentation style and emotionally engaging feedback content. In this paper, we present an ambient lifestyle feedback system concept and provide insights from the design and implementation of two prototype systems, Virtual Aquarium and Mona Lisa Bookshelf. In particular, we discuss the theory and practice of effective feedback design by drawing on elementary behavioral psychology and small-scale user studies.

The {FIS} was found to be associated with many other scales, and a multiple regression suggested that higher levels of food involvement are associated with living with two or more friends, cooking for one's self, having regular meals, and being older. We then administered the {FIS} along with the Block Food Frequency questionnaire to a sample of military personnel (n=2068) and compared food intake patterns between high and low involvement subjects. The analysis suggests that food involvement, as measured by {FIS}, appears to mediate differences in food choices and food choice patterns. Corresponding author},

This article examines the interrelationships of physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and limiting television time among elementary, middle, and high school students. {METHODS:} Nationwide samples of students in grades 4 through 12 (n=4091) completed self-administered questionnaires assessing Transtheoretical Model constructs and behavioral indicators for physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and limiting television time. Analyses were conducted to compare the prevalence of students at-risk for the target behaviors across the age groups and to examine the interrelationships of the target behavior risks. {RESULTS:} Across the three age groups, physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption declined, while limiting {TV} time increased. In addition, high school students had the greater number of behavioral risks. Across all three samples, being at-risk for one behavior almost always significantly increased the odds of being at-risk for another behavior. {CONCLUSION:} The findings of this study provide further evidence for the need for early promotion of healthy lifestyle behaviors. The relationships among the target behaviors in three samples strongly support a multiple behavior approach for obesity prevention.

The purpose of this study was to examine the reliability of stage of change {(SOC)} measures for moderate-intensity and vigorous physical activity in two separate samples of young adults. Staging measures have focused on vigorous exercise, but current public health guidelines emphasize moderate-intensity activity.
Method

For college students in the {USA} (n = 105) and in Australia (n = 123), {SOC} was assessed separately on two occasions for moderate-intensity activity and for vigorous activity. Test–retest repeatability was determined, using Cohen’s kappa coefficient.
Results

In both samples, the reliability scores for the moderate-intensity physical activity staging measure were lower than the scores for the vigorous exercise staging measure. Weighted kappa values for the moderate-intensity staging measure were in the “fair to good” range for both studies (0.50 and 0.45); for the vigorous staging measure kappa values were “excellent” and “fair to good” (0.76 and 0.72).
Conclusions

There is a need to standardize and improve methods for staging moderate-intensity activity, given that such measures are used in public health interventions targeting {HEPA} (health-enhancing physical activity).},

Constructs such as self-efficacy, self-esteem, outcome expectancies, health value, and locus of control are examined. Self-efficacy has repeatedly been a good predictor of health behavior, sometimes explaining more than 50\% of variability. Research on locus of control and other predictive factors has been less conclusive. The take-home message is threefold: (a) task specificity of self-efficacy and domain specificity of locus of control are crucial for unraveling their effects on behavior; (b) careful segmentation of different population groups under study may explain the inconsistencies in previous research; and (c) especially when studying dietary behavior, these predictors of behavior change should not be used alone or in place of one another but should be used simultaneously to explain complex food and diet-related behaviors. We recommend that nutritionists systematically integrate available theories and models and explore new areas for studying human behavior, such as sociology and anthropology, to form a more powerful, comprehensive model for behavior change.

Outcomes show that acceptance factors are neither static nor independent from the specific usage or service context in which a technology is applied.

The personnelpsilas movements, network disruptions and other system dynamics make it hard to implement robust applications for such environments. The {MIDAS} project aims at creating a middleware platform to simplify the task of developing and deploying mobile and robust services for events in which the network might be set-up at short notice. {MANETs} may be used because infrastructure is non-existing, and the number of users might be very high. One of the application domains addressed by {MIDAS} are emergency and rescue operations. To get a broad acceptance of the {MIDAS} solutions, security and privacy issues need also to be addressed. In this paper, we analyze the security threats and present a two-way approach to securing the {MIDAS} architecture. In the bottom-up approach, we use an efficient key management protocol to establish trust, and in the top-down approach we use dynamic role based access control to secure the system and provide privacy.},

	abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

	abstract = {Self-monitoring is the centerpiece of behavioral weight loss intervention programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies. Of the 22 studies identified, 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring, one on self-monitoring exercise, and six on self-weighing. A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring; the paper diary was used most often. Adherence to self-monitoring was reported most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency of log-ins or reported weights. The use of technology, which included the Internet, personal digital assistants, and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies. Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss. A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found; however, the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations. The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report. In all but two studies, the samples were predominantly white and women. This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations, for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring, and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes.},

Self-monitoring can facilitate behavioral change by providing feedback regarding goal attainment. Glycemic index {(GI)} quantifies the glycemic response to carbohydrate-containing foods. Low {GI} diets may improve weight and glycemic control. We examined the relation between self-monitoring and changes in diet and body weight following an intervention in which consumption of low {GI} foods was encouraged among adults aged 40-70 years with {diabetes.Methods}
Pre/post-intervention dietary intake was assessed with 24-h dietary recalls and weight was obtained. Mean number of days participants kept self-monitoring records was determined. The impact of self-monitoring on the change in {GI}, fiber intake, weight and body mass index {(BMI)} was evaluated using regression {analyses.Results}
Each additional day of self-monitoring was associated with a mean reduction in weight and {BMI} of -0.95�kg and -0.34�kg/m2, respectively. The mean change in fiber intake increased in men but did not significantly change in women for each additional day of {monitoring.Conclusion}
Self-monitoring was associated with weight loss in men and women and greater fiber intake in {men.Practice} Implications
Men can self-monitor to lose weight and increase fiber intake. Self-monitoring facilitates weight loss in women but other behavioral strategies are needed to improve fiber intake.},

We carried out semi-structured interviews with nineteen cardiac rehabilitation participants. Our main findings relate to distinctions between implicit and conscious change, tensions between cardiac rehabilitation and everyday life, the importance of self-awareness and self-determination, and an overall reluctance towards unnecessary self-monitoring. In view of these findings, we then offer suggestions as to how self-monitoring technologies can be designed to suit this particular context of use.},

Social cognitive theory {(SCT)} may explain how other variables, such as self-regulation and self-efficacy, may be key to integrating healthier nutrition into {U.S.} lifestyles. Purpose: To determine how {SCT} accounts for the nutritional content of food purchases and consumption among adults in a health promotion study. Methods: Participants were 712 churchgoers (18\% African American, 66\% female, 79\% overweight or obese) from 14 churches in southwestern Virginia participating in the baseline phase of a larger health promotion study. Data were collected on the nutrition related social support, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and self-regulation components of {SCT}, as well as on the fat, fiber, fruit, and vegetable content of food-shopping receipts and food frequency questionnaires. These data were used to test the fit of models ordered as prescribed by {SCT} and subjected to structural equation analysis. Results: {SCT} provided a good fit to the data explaining 35\%, 52\%, and 59\% of observed variance in percent calories from fat, fiber g/1000 kcals and fruit and vegetable servings/1000 kcals. Participants’ age, gender, socioeconomic status, social support, self-efficacy, negative outcome expectations, and self-regulation made important contributions to their nutrition behavior—a configuration of influences consistent with {SCT.} Conclusions: These results suggest a pivotal role for self-regulatory behavior in the healthier food choices of adults. Interventions effective at garnering family support, increasing nutrition related self-efficacy, and overcoming negative outcome expectations should be more successful at helping adults enact the self-regulatory behaviors essential to buying and eating healthier foods.},

The objective of this study was to assess the reliability, validity, and feasibility of using {PDA} in place of paper versions of the International Prostate Symptom Score {(IPSS)}, the Patient Oriented Prostate Cancer Utility Survey {(PORPUS)}, and the International Index of Erectile Function-5 {(IIEF-5)} in a prostate cancer clinic setting. {METHODS:} 152 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) paper followed by {PDA} survey; 2) {PDA} followed by paper survey; or 3) {PDA} followed by {PDA} survey. Evaluation included an assessment of data quality (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, response correlation, completeness of data), and feasibility (participation rates, time to completion, preference and difficulty/ease of using {PDA).} {RESULTS:} Internal consistency was similar for both {PDA} and paper applications. Test-retest reliability was confirmed for {PDA} repeated administration. Data from paper and {PDA} questionnaires were strongly correlated. Lower missed item rates were found in {PDA} administration. 82.8\% of participants preferred using the {PDA} or had no preference. Mean difficulty/ease ratings indicated that participants found the {PDA} easy to use. Age did not significantly correlate with preference or difficulty. {CONCLUSION:} The results confirm the adaptability of the {IPSS}, {IIEF-5}, and the {PORPUS} to {PDA} administration.

	abstract = {Background. Eating behavior is an etiologic factor in the development of lifestyle-related diseases. Knowledge about the stability of eating behavior during the transition from adolescence to early adulthood has implication for dietary interventions for children and young adolescents.

Method. Dietary data were collected by means of a short food frequency questionnaire as part of a Norwegian longitudinal cohort study on health behavior, lifestyle, and self-reported health of adolescents. Of 885 14-year-old baseline participants, 521 21-year-olds participated and 40\% completed all surveys at each time point.

Results. Mean weekly frequency of consumption of fruit and vegetables decreased by 1–2.5 times per week between ages 14 and 21, whereas that of sugar-containing soft drinks increased by almost 1 time per week between ages 15 and 16. Tracking of consumption patterns into young adulthood was seen for all four foods {(P} {\textless} 0.05 for differences in means between the tracking groups). The proportions of individuals remaining in the same tracking categories at the major transition stages were 50–70\%. Yet, some changed in the opposite direction of the observed trends.

Conclusions. Despite the overall changes in mean weekly frequency of consumption and prevalence of daily consumers, relative ranking by frequency at age 14 indicated some stability of eating behavior into young adulthood.},

To compare three non-dieting interventions that focused on lifestyle change rather than weight loss, in terms of the sustainability of improvements in lifestyle behaviors, psychological well-being and medical symptoms at {2�years.Method}
In Dunedin, New Zealand in 2002/2003, 225 obese/overweight women {(BMI�{\textgreater}=�28;} 25-68�years) participated in a randomised, intention-to-treat trial comparing two group programs {(P1}, P2) and a self-guided mail-delivered program {(P3).} Only P1 included intensive relaxation response training. All three non-dieting interventions involved a 10-week program, followed by an eight-month support phase. Participants completed baseline, 1-year and 2-year assessments. Outcomes included behavioral, psychological and medical symptom measures and a composite success {score.Results}
118 participants completed the 2-year follow-up. Only among P1 participants were the reductions in psychological distress and medical symptoms achieved at 1�year, also maintained at 2�years. At 2�years, P1 participants had significantly greater increases in stress management behaviors than those in P2 (p�{\textless}�0.05), and significantly greater success scores than those in P3 (p�{\textless}�0.05). In all three programs, mean weight was unchanged at {2�years.Conclusion}
Inclusion of relaxation response training in a healthy lifestyle program facilitates long-term maintenance of psychological and medical symptom improvements even in the absence of weight loss.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The Internet provides a widely accessible platform for weight loss interventions. Automated tools can allow self-guided monitoring of food intake and other target behaviours that are established correlates of weight change. Many programmes also offer social support from the virtual community. The aim of this research was to assess associations between engagement with self-monitoring tools and social support, and weight loss in an online weight-control programme.


{METHODS}

This paper describes a retrospective analysis of weight change among 3621 subscribers to a commercial Internet-based weight loss programme. Participants were all subscribers (2979 women; 642 men) joining the programme between July 2005 and November 2008 with two or more recorded weights spanning at least 28 days of participation in the programme. Engagement was indexed with frequency of using online diet and exercise diaries and with use of the social support forums.


{RESULTS}

Programme engagement was associated with weight loss in both men and women after controlling for initial {BMI} and duration of participation. The three engagement variables accounted for 13\% of variance in percentage weight loss in women (p {\textless} .001) and 19\% in men (p {\textless} .001). In analyses including all the engagement variables, exercise diary use was an independent predictor of weight loss among men, but non-significant in women. In contrast, use of the online forums was associated with weight loss in women but not in men. Among participants who were overweight or obese, those in the highest tertile of engagement with food diaries (vs the lowest) were more likely to achieve clinically significant ({\textgreater} 5\%) weight loss (men: {OR} = 3.45 p {\textless} .001; women: {OR} = 5.05 p {\textless} .001). Being in the highest tertile of engagement with exercise diaries was associated with clinically significant weight loss in men {(OR} = 3.48 p {\textless} .001) and, less strongly, in women {(OR} = 1.46 p {\textless} .05).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Use of self-monitoring tools and participation in online support are predictive of weight loss in the context of a commercial, online weight control programme.},

	abstract = {Medical informatics, broadly defined as the integration of information technology in healthcare, is revolutionizing all aspects of medicine from electronic medical record systems to portable systems that assist clinicians with medical decision-making and data entry. The human-computer interface issues in medical informatics are particularly interesting because there are often diverse user groups with different requirements for the same application (i.e., clinicians and patients).

In this dissertation, I present studies that inform the design of the Dietary Intake Monitoring Application {(DIMA)}, a patient-centered application designed to assist dialysis patients in monitoring their dietary needs. Dialysis patients who do not comply with their dietary restrictions run the risk of undergoing additional emergency dialysis, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and death. Currently, patients try to remember their fluid and sodium consumption or record it in a food diary. However, these techniques fail in 80\% of dialysis patients. We provide patients with a personal digital assistant application to record their fluid and sodium intake.

The varying levels of patient literacy and computing skills present a challenge for the design of {DIMA.} Furthermore, evaluating {DIMA} is a challenge because user studies must be conducted in dialysis wards, which are small, stressful, prohibit audio/video recordings, and change rapidly without warning. This dissertation presents methods to make patients more comfortable using {DIMA} in their everyday lives, a framework for usability studies in non-traditional environments, and interface design guidelines for people with varying literacy skills.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate a revision of the Diet Quality Index called the Diet Quality Index Revised {(DQI-R)}
Design The original Diet Quality Index was revised to reflect current dietary guidance, to incorporate improved methods of estimating food servings, and to develop and incorporate measures of dietary variety and moderation. The scoring of the original scale was reversed in direction and expanded to a 100-point scale to improve interpretability.
Methods/subjects Data from the 1994 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals were used. A sample of 3,202 adults aged 18 and older contributed 2 days of dietary intake data based on 24-hour recalls for the development and revision of various components of the {DQI-R.}
Statistical analyses Pearson correlation analyses, ordinary least squares regression analyses, and a nonparametric test to determine trends across ordered groups were used.
Results The mean {DQI-R} score for the 1994 sample was 63.4 of a possible 100-point score. Sample respondents were more likely to have met dietary guidance in the areas of dietary cholesterol (66.9\% met goal) and iron intakes (59.6\% met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowances but less likely to have met goals related to fruit servings (19.6\% met goal), grain servings (23.1\% met goal), and calcium intakes (16.6\% met goal) relative to the Recommended Dietary Allowance. There is a statistically significant quantitative and qualitative improvement in all components of the {DQI-R} as one moves from the lowest grouping of scores to the highest. For example, persons with {DQI-R} scores less than 40 consumed 43.9\% of energy from fat, 72\% of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 6.7\% of the recommended servings of fruit per day. In contrast, those with {DQI-R} scores greater than 80 consumed 24.2\% of energy from fat, 101\% of the Adequate Intake for calcium, and 137\% of the recommended servings of fruit per day.
Applications The {DQI-R} reflects the dietary guidance principles of macronutrient distribution, moderation, variety, and proportionality. Although the index was designed to monitor dietary changes in populations rather than individuals, each index component reflects an aspect of national dietary guidance. Calculation of {DQI-R} scores for an individual should provide an estimate of diet quality relative to national guidelines, and differences in scores over time should suggest improvement or decline in overall diet quality.

Design The Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)} was developed based on a 10-component system of five food groups, four nutrients, and a measure of variety in food intake. Each of the 10 components has a score ranging from 0 to 10, so the total possible index score is 100.
Methods/subjects Data from the 1989 and 1990 Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals were used to analyze the {HEI} for a representative sample of the {US} population.
Statistical analyses performed Frequencies, correlation coefficients, means.
Results The mean {HEI} was 63.9; most people scored neither very high nor very low. No one component of the index dominated the {HEI} score. People were most likely to do poorly in the fruit, saturated fat, grains, vegetable, and total fat categories. The {HEI} correlated positively and significantly with most nutrients; as the total {HEI} increased, intake for a range of nutrients also increased.
Discussion/conclusions The {HEI} is a useful index of overall diet quality of the consumer. The {US} Department of Agriculture will use the {HEI} to monitor changes in dietary intake over time and as the basis of nutrition promotion activities for the population.

The system gradually adapts to the user, enabling the affect descriptors it presents to be increasingly relevant. An initial study with 51 subjects, using a I week time-sampling with 8 to 10 randomized signals per day, produced n = 2,813 records with good reliability measures (e.g., response rate of 88.8\%, mean split-half reliability of .86), user acceptance, and usability. Multilevel analyses show circadian and hebdomadal patterns, and significant individual and situational variance components of the basic dimension evaluations. Validity analyses indicate sound assignment of qualitative affect descriptors in the bidimensional semantic space according to the circumplex model of basic affect dimensions.

Surveys completed at the beginning and end of 7th grade asked students to self-report fruit and vegetable consumption, weight-related perceptions, goals, and behaviors, and demographic variables.
Results. Underweight boys reported 0.8 fewer {F\&V} servings per day than boys who reported their weight to be [`]about right' {(P} = 0.002), while overweight girls reported 0.7 fewer {F\&V} than girls who reported their weight to be [`]about right' {(P} = 0.005). Boys with weight-related goals consumed significantly more {F\&V} than did boys not wanting to do anything about their weight {(P} {\textless} 0.05). Girls engaging in weight-related behaviors reported 0.7 more {F\&V} than girls who did not engage in weight-related behaviors {(P} = 0.006).
Conclusions. Because {F\&V} intake is low among all adolescents, population interventions should take place to increase {F\&V} intake. These data support the inclusion of gender-specific intervention components related to weight-related perceptions, goals, and behaviors.},

	abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior {(Ajzen}, 1985 and Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

This article describes the background and design of the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study {(SNDA-III).Design}
{SNDA-III} is a nationally representative cross-sectional study of the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2005. The three-stage sample design allowed description of district and school food environments and policies, analysis of foods and nutrients in school lunches and breakfasts, and assessment of the role of school meals and competitive foods in students' diets. Surveys of district and school staff were by telephone or in person; school menu data were collected in a mail survey with telephone assistance; and student and parent interviews were conducted in person and in school, except that parents of secondary-school students were interviewed by telephone. Student interviews included a 24-hour dietary recall, as well as measurement of height and weight. Response rates were 83\% for districts, 95\% for schools, and 63\% for students, whose participation was constrained by consent issues and school {schedules.Subjects/setting}
Data were collected from 130 public school food authorities (districts that offer federally subsidized school meals), 398 schools within those districts, and 2,314 public-school students in grades 1 through 12 in these schools. Of the 2,314 students, a random subset of 666 (29\%) completed a second recall to permit estimation of usual nutrient intake {distributions.Statistical} analyses performed
Descriptive tabulations were used to summarize the background characteristics of schools and students and most study outcomes. Multivariate regression models and propensity score matching were used to compare the nutrient intakes of school meal participants and {nonparticipants.Conclusions}
{SNDA-III} data provide a rich resource for examining interactions among the school meal programs, the school food environment, students' diets, and child obesity. Subsequent articles in this Supplement present analyses in all these areas.},

In addition to their medical examinations, the 12 study volunteers rated subjective complaints in a previous termdiarynext term program on 4 examination days, for a duration of 4.5 hours every 15 minutes at each visit. This resulted in 903 data sets consisting of five questions each, or 4515 data points total. In this study the use of handheld computers resulted in an increase in data quality and shortened the time needed to close the database. Moreover, the benefit of electronic reminders for protocol compliance is clearly demonstrated. Our findings support the results found in the literature we reviewed. For more than 16 years, mobile computers have been supporting the implementation of clinical trials. Our review of 27 articles out of more than 100 clinical trials in which mobile computers have been used elaborates on the advantages and problems of this technology. We give a comprehensive overview of the various technologies as used in different settings, and then discuss the methodology of using mobile devices in comparison to traditional methods, the considerations that need to be made and things to be avoided in order to conduct a successful clinical trial with mobile tools. We conclude that mobile devices are very useful in most cases, especially when design and software validation aspects have been taken into account.},

We used these strategies to design and build a system that encourages people to lead a physically active lifestyle.

Here, the proximal predictors of eating are explored in a natural setting. Research from laboratory settings suggests that restrained eaters overeat after experiencing anxiety, distraction, and the presence of positive or negative moods, but not hunger; whereas the only factor that triggers eating in unrestrained eaters is hunger. In this study, 137 female participants reported hourly for 2 days on these potential predictors and their eating using electronic diaries, allowing us to establish the relationships between these factors while participants went about their normal daily activities. The main outcome variables were the number of servings eaten and whether or not food was eaten. Contrary to findings from laboratory settings, in everyday life restrained eaters (1) did not overeat in response to anxiety; (2) ate less in the presence of positive or negative moods; and (3) ate more in response to hunger. The relationships between these factors and eating among unrestrained eaters were closer to those found in laboratory settings. In conclusion, predictors of eating must be studied in everyday life to develop successful interventions.},

We first present results from a set of formative studies exploring our respondents' existing transportation routines, willingness to engage in and maintain green transportation behavior, and reactions to early mobile phone "green" application design concepts. We then describe the results of a 3-week field study {(N=13)} of the {UbiGreen} Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semi-automatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.},

However, the mobile space presents a number of key challenges, many of which go beyond issues with device characteristics such as screen-size and input capabilities. In particular, changing contexts such as location, time, activity and social interactions are likely to impact on the types of information needs that arise. In order to offer personalized, effective mobile services we need to understand mobile users in more detail. Thus we carried out a four-week diary study of mobile information needs, looking in particular at the goal/intent behind mobile information needs, the topics users are interested in and the impact of mobile contexts such as location and time on user needs.},

Modern technological developments bring great promise for the realization of such large-scale persuasive behavior change interventions because they allow for user tailored interaction. For the effective tailoring of technology-based interventions, a profound understanding of the main variables underlying physical activity behavior is required. In this paper, we focus on three cognitive variables that have shown to be crucial for the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors: behavioral regulation, types of motives, and self-efficacy. In particular, we explore the relationship of these cognitive variables with actual levels of daily-life physical activity. Our study differs from related studies in two important ways. First, we consider the entire range of physical activities performed throughout the day while many studies focused on sports and or dedicated exercise. Second, we employ a wearable device for the objective measurement of daily physical activity levels rather than rely on self-report measures. Our results show that active individuals feel higher levels of self-determined behavioral regulation, experience stronger motives to be active (in particular for health and well-being related motives), and have higher levels of self-efficacy for daily-life physical activity than inactive individuals. We argue that tailored technology-based activity interventions should accommodate these cognitive variables and for inactive individuals, aim to gradually induce and internalize the cognitions already experienced by active individuals.},

	abstract = {Obesity is a major public health challenge with over 65\% of {U.S.} adults either overweight or obese. Estimated annual costs of obesity are around \$78.5 billion. Self-monitoring is a critical skill for successful weight management. However, self-monitoring is labor-intensive and compliance is often difficult. In this paper, we describe the Patient-Centered Assessment and Counseling Mobile Energy Balance {(PmEB)} cell phone application that allows users to self-monitor caloric balance in real time. We developed and applied a four-phase iterative research and development methodology. We conducted a usability study and a preliminary feasibility study. The one month feasibility study measured compliance and satisfaction among a sample of 15 participants randomized to one of three groups: 1) a paper diary group, 2) a {PmEB} group with one daily prompt, and 3) a {PmEB} group with three daily prompts. {PmEB} scored highly on usability, compliance, and satisfaction. In addition, cell phone group users scored {PmEB} the same as or better than Paper Group members scored the paper diary in nearly all categories. Thematic analysis of comments revealed very positive reviews of {PmEB} as well as areas for improvement. {PmEB} is both usable and feasible for self-monitoring in weight management, and our iterative pilot study methodology was effective in improving its usability},

However, few of these are easy to use and to integrate with users' daily routines and necessary medical or fitness equipment in a way that motivates long-term use. Our research group is working with the easy health diary, a self-help tool for people with type 2 diabetes. The tool is based on smartphones, and its functionality applies to each of the three cornerstones of diabetes management: physical activity, nutrition and healthy blood glucose values. The target user group is typically aged 50 or more, so it is especially important that a self-help tool should have low technical thresholds and a highly usable design. Such tools may also support applications to help the general population meet today's vast health challenges. A prototype has been designed and tested on 32 people: 12 users with type 2 diabetes and 20 individuals without diabetes. All informants had a generally positive reaction to the prototype and the user group was more positive than the reference group. The informants emphasized the importance of making the tool extremely easy to use and integrated with the everyday routines of the users.},

At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and percent calories from total fat and saturated fatty acids {(P{\textless}0.001);} no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the {PDA} group significantly increased consumption of fruit {(P=0.02)} and vegetables {(P=0.04)} and decreased consumption of refined grains {(P=0.02).} Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in percent calories from total fat {(P=0.02)}, monounsaturated fatty acids {(P=0.002)}, and trans-fatty acids {(P=0.04).} Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar {(P=0.02)} and added sugar {(P=0.01)} intake in both groups.

Successful dietary behavior change programs target 1 or more of the personal, behavioral, or environmental factors that influence the behavior of interest and apply theory-based strategies to influence or change those factors. Goal setting is a strategy that is frequently used to help people change. A 4-step goal-setting process has been identified: recognizing a need for change; establishing a goal; adopting a goal-directed activity and self-monitoring it; and self-rewarding goal attainment. The applications of goal setting in dietary interventions for adults and children are reviewed here. Because interventions using goal setting appear to promote dietary change, dietitians should consider incorporating the goal-setting strategies to enhance the behavior change process in nutrition education programs.

	abstract = {Background

Portable hand-held information technology offers much promise not only in assessing dietary intake in the real world, but also in providing dietary feedback to individuals. However, stringent research designs have not been employed to examine whether it can be effective in modifying dietary behaviors. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant {[PDA])} for increasing vegetable and whole-grain intake over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults, using a randomized study design.
Methods

Twenty-seven healthy adults aged ≥50 were randomized and completed the 8-week study. Intervention participants received an instructional session and a {PDA} programmed to monitor their vegetable and whole-grain intake levels twice per day and to provide daily individualized feedback, goal-setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate, written nutritional education materials. Dietary intake was assessed via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.
Results

Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in vegetable servings (1.5–2.5 servings/day; p=0.02), as well as a trend toward greater intake of dietary fiber from grains (3.7–4.5 servings/day; p=0.10).
Conclusions

This study's findings provide preliminary evidence that using portable hand-held technology to provide daily individualized feedback on dietary behavior in the real world can increase the dietary intake of healthy food groups.},

The user study included interviews with the {HRM} users and a survey with over 860 active or former users. We identified four different types of {HRM} users based on the current usage activity and their perceived progress of usage motivation within time, and compared their perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses related to {HRMs.} The findings provide valuable information for understanding the end-user needs and background knowledge for developing personal wellness technologies and applications further.},

Moreover, intentionally or not, many individuals have difficulty keeping faithful records. We used instrumented paper previous termdiariesnext term {(IPDs)} to study self-monitoring in randomly chosen participants in the {PREFER} trial, a behavioral treatment for weight-loss study. The previous termdiariesnext term they used to self-report eating were periodically replaced with {IPDs} at various times during an 18-month weight-loss program, consisting of three successive phases: intense treatment (n = 35), less-intense treatment (n = 13), and maintenance (n = 16). We compared electronically documented self-monitoring data, showing when and how often {IPDs} were used, with self-reported data, then compared the electronically validated adherence and weight loss. Self-reported previous termdiarynext term usage exceeded {IPD-documented} usage while the electronic data demonstrated a significant decline in self-monitoring over time. previous {termDiarynext} term recording often was not timely. Percentage weight lost correlated significantly with frequency of {IPD} use (p = .001) and the number of previous termdiarynext term entries made within 15 min of opening the {IPD} (p = .002). This is the first study to document patterns of self-monitoring among participants in a weight-loss program, which demonstrated that individuals may falsify the times and frequency of self-monitoring. Furthermore, our results showed that adherence to self-monitoring and the timeliness of recording significantly correlate with improved weight loss.},

	note = {Background:  The Internet has potential as a medium for health behavior change programs, but no controlled studies have yet evaluated the impact of a fully automated physical activity intervention over several months with real-time objective feedback from a monitor.
Objective: The aim was to evaluate the impact of a physical activity program based on the Internet and mobile phone technology provided to individuals for 9 weeks.
Methods: A single-center, randomized, stratified controlled trial was conducted from September to December 2005 in Bedfordshire, United Kingdom, with 77 healthy adults whose mean age was 40.4 years {(SD} = 7.6) and mean body mass index was 26.3 {(SD} = 3.4). Participants were randomized to a test group that had access to an Internet and mobile phone–based physical activity program (n = 47) or to a control group (n = 30) that received no support. The test group received tailored solutions for perceived barriers, a schedule to plan weekly exercise sessions with mobile phone and email reminders, a message board to share their experiences with others, and feedback on their level of physical activity. Both groups were issued a wrist-worn accelerometer to monitor their level of physical activity; only the test group received real-time feedback via the Internet. The main outcome measures were accelerometer data and self-report of physical activity.
Results: At the end of the study period, the test group reported a significantly greater increase over baseline than did the control group for perceived control {(P} {\textless} .001) and intention/expectation to exercise {(P} {\textless} .001). Intent-to-treat analyses of both the accelerometer data {(P} = .02) and leisure time self-report data {(P} = .03) found a higher level of moderate physical activity in the test group. The average increase (over the control group) in accelerometer-measured moderate physical activity was 2 h 18 min per week. The test group also lost more percent body fat than the control group (test group: −2.18, {SD} = 0.59; control group: −0.17, {SD} = 0.81; P = .04).
Conclusions: A fully automated Internet and mobile phone–based motivation and action support system can significantly increase and maintain the level of physical activity in healthy adults.},

{Design:A} quasiexperimental pretest, posttest design was used in a random sample of students in two junior high schools.
{Methods:The} intervention consisted of a combination of 5 hours of Web-based instruction and 10 hours of classroom curriculum, compared to nutrition education embedded in the standard school curriculum during a 1-month period. Participants completed six questionnaires. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t tests, and Pearson's r correlation coefficient.
Findings and {Conclusions:The} intervention group had significantly higher scores for {SE} for fruits and vegetables, {SE} for lower fat, usual food choices, and dietary knowledge of fat compared to the control group. No difference was found between groups in food consumption. Self-efficacy was significantly associated with dietary knowledge of lower fat, usual food choices, and was inversely associated with lower-fat consumption in the hypothesized model of eating behavior. The intervention was tailored to the social and developmental preferences of adolescents and effectively increased {SE} for {HE.} The mediating role of {SE} in the hypothesized model of adolescent eating behavior warrants further investigation.},

A food frequency questionnaire was mailed to participants requesting them to estimate their usual intake of specific food items. Actual food consumption was determined at each meal with self-report forms. These forms required participants to indicate foods chosen at that meal. To test the validity of the frequency questionnaire, regression equations were calculated for each individual using the frequency questionnaire data as the independent variable {(X)} and actual intake data as the dependent variable {(Y).} Eighty-four percent of the r values were greater than 0.50 and 55\% were greater than 0.71. All were significant at the 0.002 level or below. As an alternative test of validity, the percentage of over- and underestimation of each food group was also assessed. Foods which are often major components of a meal (eg, flesh foods) were estimated with greater accuracy than those foods which could be considered accessory (eg, nuts or seeds). While it appears that a large percentage of individuals could accurately estimate their intake with this technique, some individuals were unsuccessful in doing so. Further research is needed to identify individual characteristics which may predict success with this technique.},

We sought to identify health behavior change targets related to weight management in college students. Based on the Social Cognitive Theory model for health behavior change, we investigated the health-related lifestyle behaviors and physiological characteristics of this population. Forty-three college students (18.3�0.1 years) completed a series of quantitative assessments (eg, body weight and composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and diet and activity habits) and structured qualitative assessments (ie, structured interview or focus group). Participants were predominantly normal weight (mean body mass index 22.2�0.4) and fit (maximal oxygen consumption 50.5�1.5 {mL/kg/minute).} However, healthful eating and physical activity were not considered high priorities, despite having ample free time, high exercise self-efficacy, positive outcome expectations for exercise, and a desire to exercise more. Participants reported that regularly engaging in exercise was difficult. This may have been due to poor planning/time management, satisfaction with body image, lack of accountability, and feelings of laziness. Dietary patterns generally met recommendations but were low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Social support for exercise and healthful dietary habits were important factors associated with health behaviors. Students reported a decline in exercise and dietary habits relative to high school, which may have contributed to college weight gain. Our results suggest that this population may not have adequate self-regulatory skills, such as planning and self-monitoring, to maintain healthful behaviors in the college environment. Food and nutrition professionals working with young adults attending college may use these findings to guide the behavioral therapy component of their weight management medical nutrition therapy goals and outcomes.},

Working memory and other supportive cognitive processes involved in learning are reviewed in the context of developing patient education materials. We specifically focus on the impact of certain design factors such as text format and syntax, the inclusion of images, and the choice of modality on individuals' ability to understand and remember health {information.Methods}
A selective review of relevant cognitive and learning theories is discussed with regard to their potential impact on the optimal design of health {materials.Results}
Working memory is measured as an individual's capacity to hold and manipulate information in active consciousness. It is limited by necessity, and well-designed health materials can effectively minimize extraneous cognitive demands placed on individuals, making working memory resources more available to better process content-related {information.Conclusions}
Further research is needed to evaluate specific design principles and identify ideal uses of print versus video-based forms of communication for conveying {information.Practice} implications
The process of developing health materials should account for the cognitive demands that extrinsic factors such as modality place on patients.},
