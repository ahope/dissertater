We implemented a wearable computing platform consisting of an array of sensors and application software to motivate users to reach fitness goals and prevent harm in a real-time environment. Evaluation and testing were done on 65 users in four groups: students, health club members, {ROTC} members and baby boomer-age individuals. Comparing the personal wellness coach against an existing exercise product, our results indicate that this system is an effective tool that is less intrusive and in some cases can perform like a personal trainer and help improve user efficiency.},

	abstract = {Individual wellness comprises both psychological and physiological wellbeing, which are interrelated. In long-term monitoring of wellness, both components should be included. Work-related stress and burnout are persistent problems in industrial countries. Early identification of work-related stress symptoms and early intervention could reduce individual suffering and improve the working productivity and creativity. The goal of this study was to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological variables measured at home by the users themselves or automatically. In all, 17 (3 males and 14 females, age 40–62) people participating in a work ability rehabilitation program (due to work overload) were monitored for three months. Physiological and behavioral variables (activity, bed occupancy, heart rate {(HR)} and respiration during night, {HR} during day, blood pressure, steps, weight, room illumination, and temperature) were measured with different unobtrusive wireless sensors. Daily self-assessment of stress, mood, and behaviors (exercise, sleep) were collected using a mobile phone diary. The daily self-assessment of stress and the Derogatis stress profile questionnaire were used as reference for stress status. Results show modest, but significant pooled overall correlations between self-assessed stress level, and physiological and behavioral variables (e.g., sleep length measured with wrist-worn activity monitor:  \$rho = -hbox{0.22}\$, \$p ≪ hbox{0.001}\$, and variance of nightly bedroom illumination: \$rho = hbox{0.13}\$, \$p ≪ hbox{0.001}\$).

The process and outcomes were evaluated using real-time food records collected through the {PDAs;} surveys; and self-reported food frequency questionnaires. {RESULTS:} Participants significantly increased self-monitoring, improved their attitudes toward self-monitoring, and met their dietary goals more often. Reported total fat intake and percent energy from fat decreased significantly. There was a modest decrease in mean caloric intake. {DISCUSSION:} The pilot study findings support the largely untapped potential of hand-held computers for improving diet monitoring and diet adherence, particularly within a clinical trial.},

Statistical analysis

Differences in estimated median nutrient intake among the three methods were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Relationships among the nutrient estimates by each method were evaluated using Spearman rank correlation coefficients.
Results

We found no significant differences between the Wellnavi method when compared with food records for most nutrients, except zinc, manganese, vitamin E, saturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid, and dietary fiber. The median correlation coefficients for the nutrient estimates were 0.66 between the Wellnavi method and the food records.

The study included 44 Japanese participants without diabetes (mean age 23 years) and 16 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 53 years). The {PDA-based} food diary was used for 7 consecutive days. Information about all dietary intake on the 7th day of {PDA} self-monitoring was collected by a 24-hour recall interview on the 8th day. The {PDA-based} data for dietary intake on the 7th day were then compared to the 24-hour recall data for the same period. Feasibility was assessed based on the frequency and timeliness of self-monitoring. There was no significant difference in daily totals for energy, protein, carbohydrate, and fat between the two methods in each group. Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients showed strong significant relationships for all variables between the two methods in both groups. Bland-Altman plots did not indicate any bias in estimated daily caloric intake. Participants recorded 98\% of their meals in the {PDA}, with 75\% of entries recorded within 6 hours after the meal starting time.

The one month feasibility study measured compliance and satisfaction among a sample of 15 participants randomized to one of three groups: 1) a paper diary group, 2) a {PmEB} group with one daily prompt, and 3) a {PmEB} group with three daily prompts. {PmEB} scored highly on usability, compliance, and satisfaction. In addition, cell phone group users scored {PmEB} the same as or better than Paper Group members scored the paper diary in nearly all categories.

	abstract = {There is a growing concern about chronic diseases and other health problems related to diet including obesity and cancer. The need to accurately measure diet (what foods a person consumes) becomes imperative. Dietary intake provides valuable insights for mounting intervention programs for prevention of chronic diseases. Measuring accurate dietary intake is considered to be an open research problem in the nutrition and health fields. In this paper, we describe a novel mobile telephone food record that will provide an accurate account of daily food and nutrient intake. Our approach includes the use of image analysis tools for identification and quantification of food that is consumed at a meal. Images obtained before and after foods are eaten are used to estimate the amount and type of food consumed. The mobile device provides a unique vehicle for collecting dietary information that reduces the burden on respondents that are obtained using more classical approaches for dietary assessment. We describe our approach to image analysis that includes the segmentation of food items, features used to identify foods, a method for automatic portion estimation, and our overall system architecture for collecting the food intake information.},

	abstract = {Health problems related to diet, including obesity and cancer, are important concerns in the current society. The main treatment for obesity includes dieting and frequent physical activity. Diet programs keep and cause weight loss over short, medium, or long term. However, to maintain balanced body energy, a frequent physical exercise is required. This paper presents {SapoFitness}, a mobile health application for a dietary evaluation and the implementation of challenges, alerts, and constantly motivates the user to use the system and keep the diet plan. {SapoFitness} is customized to its user keeping a daily record of his/her food intake and daily exercise. The main goal of this application is to offer a motivation tool for weight reduction and increase physical activity. {SapoFitness} includes the ability to share personal achievements with social networks, a very intuitive human-device interaction and control weight, applying not only to control obesity but also to malnutrition problems. The application offers a continuous alert system activity, sending alerts/messages concerning the user diet program taking into account also his/her physical activity. {SapoFitness} is a challenged mobile application that delivers the action to the user, motivating for a healthier life style.},

	abstract = {Changes in diet and lifestyle are leading to a dramatic worldwide increase in chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes [1]. The demand for health-related support is thus growing, and many self-help tools are available. However, few of these are easy to use and to integrate with users' daily routines and necessary medical or fitness equipment in a way that motivates long-term use. Our research group is working with the easy health diary, a self-help tool for people with type 2 diabetes. The tool is based on smartphones, and its functionality applies to each of the three cornerstones of diabetes management: physical activity, nutrition and healthy blood glucose values. The target user group is typically aged 50 or more, so it is especially important that a self-help tool should have low technical thresholds and a highly usable design. Such tools may also support applications to help the general population meet today's vast health challenges. A prototype has been designed and tested on 32 people: 12 users with type 2 diabetes and 20 individuals without diabetes. All informants had a generally positive reaction to the prototype and the user group was more positive than the reference group. The informants emphasized the importance of making the tool extremely easy to use and integrated with the everyday routines of the users.},
