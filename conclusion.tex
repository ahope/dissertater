\chapter{Future Work and Conclusion}
\label{cha:futureWork}
In this dissertation, I have described three projects that explore the design,  development and evaluation of mobile phone food diaries. The BALANCE project incorporated a physical activity sensing unit and energy balance visualization with the food diary. The design process depended on the use of focus groups. An in-lab study characterized the benefits and drawbacks of using a mobile phone food diary based on food indexes to self-monitor dietary intake. Finally, the POND tool and study investigated the use of a food index-based food diary on a mobile phone. 

[JAK: I would definitely like to see some sort of synthesis of all your projects and some overall discussion of what can be learned from each. What were the major findings? What were the lessons you learned? What are the next steps and where do you see the field going? What can others take away from your work? Restate your contributions and summarize how your studies answered them.] 

The BALANCE study taught us that many people find the use of a nutrient-based or database-dependent approach for self-monitoring dietary intake is challenging by nature. Even when the technology is improved (more memory, increased processing power, more natural and easy to use interface), the nature of the detailed approach is too challenging for some people. Providing more benefits in terms of automatically monitoring activity and improved visualization or analysis does not provide enough benefit for most general population. This is particularly true when time of entry is a concern. 

The multi-phase, iterative design of the BALANCE project also provided insight into the evaluation of \textit{in situ} food diary use. The focus groups and standardized questionnaires provided feedback about the current iteration of the BALANCE software, but the lack of more detailed metrics prevented us from reconciling the subjective feedback from software performance and features. The more detailed usage metrics from the validation study helped us to discover that BALANCE usage was similar to what other researchers reported. However, we also discovered that researchers have not been consistent with how they report food diary use. 


A detailed analysis of the usage metrics allowed us to better understand which metrics may be useful to capture in future work to support comparison of new tools with existing tools. 


The in-lab study taught us that using a food index-based approach for informing the design of a mobile phone food diary produced a tool that integrated data entry and analysis, resulting in less time to input. We found that the self-monitoring process can be simplified too much: just because a self-monitoring approach is fast and easy to count correctly does not make it useful (FBQI). This study also taught us that people have nutrition or dietary goals with varying characteristics: some people are more concerned with quality, while others are concerned about quantity. This could impact their willingness to continue using a particular food diary for an extended period of time. 

The in-lab study also provided an in-lab study procedure and valid tasks. 

The POND project consisted of designing and developing a mobile phone food diary based on both behavior change theory and user studies. I evaluated the POND app by performing both in-lab and \textit{in situ} studies. The initial analysis I presented as part of this dissertation included identifying how participants chose to make entries, what entries they were making, and when they were making entries. I found that some participants preferred the overview and quick entry of the +1 buttons; others preferred the accuracy of looking food up in the database; and some participants combined the two approaches. Participant entries consisted primarily of the food group components. The number nutrient component entries was smaller than expected. Finally, participants expressed frustration when they could not retroactively create food entries. The follow-up interviews indicate that participants want a tool that is flexible in regards to the user's schedule. Sometimes their schedule allows them to focus on the food diary right after eating, while other times the user needs to go back in time. 

The experience of all three of these projects make one thing clear: there is a disconnect between what users want and are able to do to self-monitor their dietary intake, and what researchers want or need. As researchers, we can provide an rigorous academic justification for why people should keep a timely, detailed journal of what they eat. However, if we are designing tools to change behavior, we need to design tools that accommodate people who are only human. 

Researchers sometimes need highly accurate, very detailed information about what people eat. These areas of research were covered in Chapter \ref{cha:relatedWork}. The self-monitoring tools for this research should support the goal of the research, but with the understanding that the it might not match the researcher goals. We should not  assume that what is appropriate for researchers who need accuracy is what is appropriate for users. 

Something I hope other researchers can take from this work is an awareness of assumptions that are made about the design and use of food diaries. This area of research has been avoided in the technology community because of its complexity. As we saw with the BALANCE study, building a traditional food diary is not a trivial project. 

When I started research in the area of mobile phone food diaries, more experienced researchers encouraged me to narrow my scope to a well-defined population, such as diabetics or patients with severe cardiovascular disease. However, I saw general populations addressed in two other areas of research: first, technology research related to self-monitoring and supporting physical activity behaviors; second, many nutrition-based studies frequently used general or convenience populations. Why was it so important to target a very specific population? Assumptions about the population are evident in much of the related research. 

This thesis has identified ways to potentially characterize populations for food diary evaluations. Through the three projects, participants could be characterized in terms of goals, motivation, and resources. Goals includes what the individual wants to achieve. Many of our self-selected participants indicated that while they would like to lose weight, they would be happy to simply improve some of their nutrition behaviors. Others indicated that these goals changed over time: sometimes they were interested in losing weight or preparing for athletic events, while others they just wanted to stay healthy.   Motivation refers to how motivated the individual is. Some participants acknowledged that they would like to lose weight, but it was not currently a high priority. Finally, resources includes how much time and money a person is willing to put into those attaining their goals. This is different than the goal or motivation. All three work together to effect an individual's self efficacy. 

We see some indication of these differences of goals, motivation and resources in the participant feedback in the BALANCE studies. The in-lab study indicated that participants with different kinds of goals may prefer different self-monitoring approaches. Metrics from the use of the POND software both in the lab and \textit{in situ} indicate that these preferences appear consistent with changes in goals, motivation and resources. This is also consistent with feedback from participants who indicate that their preferences and willingness to use different tools for self-monitoring dietary intake has changed overtime. Based on this, there could be value in future work that focuses on a more rigorous characterization of motivation, goals and resources in regards to nutrition behaviors. 

This goes back to the earlier point about choosing study populations. Specialized populations such as patients with a lifestyle disease are simply a special case. They are highly motivated to modify their nutrition behaviors consistent with what is required for their disease. These populations may also have dedicated resources that healthy populations do not.
