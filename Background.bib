	abstract = {A systematic review of the literature on dietary patterns (multiple dietary components operationalized as a single exposure) in relation to nutrient adequacy, lifestyle and demographic variables, and health outcome was conducted. Most of the published reports on the subject have used one of two methods to determine dietary patterns: (a) diet indexes or scores that assess compliance with prevailing dietary guidance as dietary patterns, and (b) data-driven methods that use factor or cluster analysis to derive dietary patterns. Irrespective of the approach used, patterns characterized by fruit/vegetable/whole grain/fish/poultry consumption generally have been reported to relate to micronutrient intake, and to selected biomarkers of dietary exposure and disease risk in the expected direction. Age, income, and education have been reported to be among positive predictors of the so-called more healthful dietary patterns. An inverse association of healthful dietary patterns with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk was reported in most studies. However, the magnitude of risk reduction was modest and was attenuated after control for confounders. Few published studies showed an association between risk of most incident cancers and dietary patterns. Both of the currently used approaches for extracting dietary patterns have limitations, are subject to dietary measurement errors, and have not generated new diet and disease hypotheses.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Study objectives were to assess the accuracy of a food record delivered on a personal digital assistant {(PDA)} and to examine sources of error from the {PDA-based} food record. {METHODS:} Thirty-nine adults recruited with a newspaper advertisement were trained to record food intake using {DietMatePro}, a dietary assessment program delivered on a {PDA.} After 3 d of use, subjects returned for a follow-up visit in which a 24-h recall was conducted. Subjects also were timed while recording an observed, weighed lunch. Recalled and actual food intakes were compared with estimates recorded by the subjects when using the {PDA.} Paired sample t tests and Pearson's correlations assessed means and measurements of association between {DietMatePro} data compared with the 24-h recall data and observed meal data. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess bias in food recording. Sources of error were quantified by using calories as the unit for comparison. {RESULTS:} There were no significant differences in daily totals for calories and macronutrients between {DietMatePro} data and comparison measurements. Pearson's correlations of associations between {DietMatePro} data and the comparison measurement ranged from 0.505 to 0.797 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 28) for the 24-h recall and from 0.419 to 0.786 {(P} {\textless} 0.005, n = 33) for the observed lunch, depending on the nutrient measured. The largest source of absolute error in caloric estimation was attributable to portion size estimation error (49\%). {CONCLUSIONS:} {DietMatePro}, a {PDA-based} dietary assessment program, provides a method of assessing energy and macronutrient intakes comparable to the 24-h recall in samples lacking dietary restrictions.},

	abstract = {Background
Comprehension of food labels can be important for patients, including those with chronic illness, to help follow dietary recommendations. Patient comprehension of food labels was examined, along with the relationship of comprehension to their underlying literacy and numeracy {skills.Methods}
From June 2004 to April 2005, a cross-sectional study of 200 primary care patients was performed. A 24-item measure of food label comprehension was administered. Literacy was measured with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine {(REALM)}, and numeracy with the Wide Range Achievement Test, third edition {(WRAT-3).Results}
Most patients (89\%) reported using food labels. While 75\% of patients reported at least a high school education and 77\% had 9th-grade literacy skills, only 37\% had 9th-grade math skills. On average, patients answered 69\% (standard deviation, 21\%) of the food-label questions correctly. Common reasons for incorrect responses included misapplication of the serving size, confusion due to extraneous material on the food label, and incorrect calculations. For example, only 37\% of patients could calculate the number of carbohydrates consumed from a 20-ounce bottle of soda that contained 2.5 servings. Higher comprehension of food labels was significantly correlated (all p values were less than 0.001) with higher income (rho=0.39), education (rho=0.49), literacy (rho=0.52), and numeracy {(rho=0.67).Conclusions}
Patients demonstrated deficits in understanding nutrition labels. Poor label comprehension was highly correlated with low-level literacy and numeracy skills, but even patients with higher literacy could have difficulties interpreting labels. Providers need to consider patients' literacy and numeracy when providing dietary recommendations. Opportunities may exist for the {U.S.} Food and Drug Administration to promote changes to make food labels more comprehensible.},

As Chung and colleagues point out, a positive aspect of the Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)} is that {“People} eat foods, therefore, food groups are easier to understand for the general public than nutrients.” Thus, nonfat milk solids were chosen as the food component that best represented the amount of milk in mixtures. If one were to calculate the number of Food Guide Pyramid servings from the milk group in mixtures based simply on the nutrient calcium, it would not be possible to determine which food or food component is the source of the calcium. For example, if a food such as a casserole contains broccoli, salmon, and cheese, each of these ingredients would have contributed some calcium. To calculate milk group servings on the basis of the calcium content of that casserole would distort the true contribution of the milk group.
Chung et al say that this “makes evaluation of calcium adequacy impossible,” but the purpose of the {HEI} is not to evaluate calcium adequacy, or for that matter the adequacy of any other single nutrient. Rather, it is to evaluate overall diet quality. The number and amounts of food group servings suggested in the Food Guide Pyramid {(USDA's} Food Guide Pyramid, {US} Depts of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, Washington, {DC} Home and Garden Bulletin No. 249. .1) were selected to cover a full range of a person's nutrient needs. Choosing the specified number of servings from the five major food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid replaces the need for persons to evaluate their diet on a nutrient-by-nutrient basis.
Chung et al also express their concern that the variety score is based on 3 days of intake rather than 1 day. However, the variety score in the {HEI} is adjusted when it is applied to 1-day dietary intake data (2). For 1 day's data, 8 different foods need to be consumed to achieve a maximum score of 10. The results of the {HEI} for 1 day vs 3 days is not significantly different. This is encouraging because most surveys collect only 1 day's dietary information.
Although, as Chung et al indicate, in some cases the minimum number of servings from the major food groups in the Food Guide Pyramid is 15, these 15 servings could be achieved with a variety count as low as 5. Thus, there is no inconsistency. The variety score is independently meaningful.
It is true that fiber is not explicitly included in the {HEI}, but here again, consumption of a variety of foods in the number and amounts of servings suggested in the Food Guide Pyramid helps ensure that individuals achieve an adequate fiber intake.

To the Editors:
Clinicians and researchers in nutrition assessment need an index for evaluating overall diet quality. However, we think the Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)} presented in the article by Kennedy et al {(The} Healthy Eating Index: Design and applications. J Am Diet Assoc. 1995; 95:1103–1108) needs further work.
The proposed {HEI} has several strengths, one of which is that it is primarily based on food groups rather than on individual nutrients. People eat foods, therefore, food groups are easier to understand for the general public than nutrients. Also, overall dietary quality is captured by the {HEI} by using the five major food groups as components 1 to 5, out of 10 total components. Truncating the number of servings for these first five components prevents inflated scores for those who simply eat a lot of food. Finally, 3 of the 10 components related to fat intake reflect the importance of the dietary recommendations to reduce fat, although research shows that dietary cholesterol is of much less importance than fat and saturated fat for risk of chronic disease (1).
We are, however, concerned that in the {HEI}, the basis for determining portion size of the milk and meat groups was changed from nutrient equivalents for calcium and protein, respectively, to commodity equivalents. This means that a serving for the milk group is based on the milk solids in 1 c milk, not on the amount of calcium. This change would reduce, for example, a single serving of cottage cheese to 1 c. {(When} based on calcium content, a single serving was 2 c.) Using commodity equivalents makes evaluation of calcium adequacy impossible, which seems counterproductive, given that interest in the relationship between calcium and hypertension has recently increased (2), and calcium intakes of {US} women are low (1).

Before the nutrition community adopts the Healthy Eating Index as a dietary quality index, further evaluation and review are needed

Variety, which is component 10 of the {HEI}, is also a problem. To achieve a perfect score of 10 on the variety component of the {HEI}, a person must eat 16 different foods over 3 days. However, because this component is assessed on 3 days of intake whereas other components are assessed on 1 day of intake, data collection and analysis are confusing. We cannot find a basis for using the criteria of 16 foods in 3 days to define variety. The Japanese recommendations are to consume 30 different foods per day (3), and {US} adults consume an average of 16.3 different foods per day (4). The minimum daily number of servings from the Food Guide Pyramid is 15, and the maximum is 24 (1). Also, it is currently impossible for practitioners or researchers to score this variety component without use of the {US} Department of Agriculture {(USDA)} Economic Research Service program.
Finally, dietary fiber is not addressed in the {HEI.} Recent research has drawn attention to the importance of the relationship between fiber and chronic disease (5). This, and the fact that fiber intakes are low in the {US} diet (1), would make it an appropriate inclusion.
Before the nutrition community adopts the {HEI} as a dietary quality index, further evaluation and review are needed. By offering these suggestions we hope to facilitate that process.

In patterns ranging from 0 to 2 servings each of fruits and vegetables, the mean percent of energy as fat varied from 39\% to 36\%. We observed a slight trend for decreasing energy from fat with increasing number of fruit-but not vegetable-servings. Consumption of fruits and vegetables was not associated with selection of lower-fat foods in the meat, dairy or grain groups. The percent of daily fat contributed by the miscellaneous food group (containing visible fats, sweeteners, and baked products with a high fat or sugar content) increased with increasing vegetable-but not fruit-servings. These results suggest that without conscious effort to reduce fat intake, an increase in fruit and vegetable intake may have a relatively minor impact on reduction of dietary fat.}

This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques {(BCTs).} Design: Twenty-six {BCTs} were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. Results: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93\% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85\%, and a comparison of {BCTs} identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74\%, with most mismatches (73\%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of {BCTs} included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.}

The validity and reliability of the {HEI-2005} were {evaluated.Design}
Validity was assessed by answering four questions: Does the {HEI-2005} 1) give maximum scores to menus developed by experts; 2) distinguish between groups with known differences in diet quality--smokers and nonsmokers; 3) measure diet quality independently of energy intake, a proxy for diet quantity; and 4) have more than one underlying dimension? The relevant type of reliability, internal consistency, was also {assessed.Subjects}
Twenty-four-hour recalls from 8,650 participants, aged 2 years and older, in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001-2002 were analyzed to answer questions 2 to 4. Results were weighted to consider sample design and {nonresponse.Statistical} analyses
T tests determined differences in scores between smokers and nonsmokers. Pearson correlation coefficients determined the relationship between energy intake and scores. Principal components analysis determined the number of factors that comprise the {HEI-2005.} Cronbach's coefficient [alpha] tested internal {consistency.Results}
{HEI-2005} scores are at or very near the maximum levels for all sets of exemplary menus with one exception; the Harvard menus scored low on the milk component because these menus intentionally include only small amounts of milk products. Nine of 12 component scores were lower for smokers than nonsmokers. The correlations of component scores were virtually independent of energy intake ({\textless} {\textbar}.22{\textbar}). Multiple factors underlie the {HEI-2005.} Coefficient [alpha] was .43. The [alpha] value for all tests was {.01.Conclusions}
The {HEI-2005} is a valid measure of diet quality. Potential uses include population monitoring, evaluation of interventions, and research. The individual component scores provide essential information in addition to that provided by the total score.},

This study investigated the relationship between diet quality and reported symptoms of depression in a low-income urban {population.Subjects/setting}
Subjects included 1,118 African-American and white adults, aged 30 to 64 years, living in Baltimore, {MD}, and represented a subsample of the initial examination and recruitment phase of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span {study.Methods}
Nutrition data were based on two 24-hour dietary recalls collected by trained interviewers using the {US} Department of Agriculture Automated Multiple Pass Method. Diet quality was calculated using the {US} Department of Agriculture Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)-2005.} Depressive symptoms were assessed by a trained interviewer using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression {scale.Statistical} analysis
Both linear and logistic regression analyses were used to examine whether or not diet quality was associated with depressive symptoms. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms and independent variables included {HEI-2005}, race, sex, age, education, income, and food-assistance program {participation.Results}
Mean {HEI-2005} score was 52.17�0.40 (out of 100). Mean Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale score was 11.64�0.25 (out of 40). Diet quality was significantly associated with reported symptoms of depression.

	abstract = {The {MyPyramid} food guidance system provides recommended food intake patterns for members of each sex at various age and activity levels. These food intake patterns are based on recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. Actual consumption patterns of American adults compared to {MyPyramid} recommendations indicate that substantial changes are needed to meet the goals of {MyPyramid.} One method for encouraging dietary change, known as the small steps approach, involves small, gradual changes to meet a desired endpoint. Menu modeling was used to evaluate the effects of gradual dietary changes on diet quality. Seven days of baseline menus were developed to model the intake of adult women aged 31 to 50 years. Incremental changes were made to each baseline menu to create a series of three transitional menus and a final target menu. Target menus met {MyPyramid} energy and nutrient intake goals. Diet quality was measured for each baseline, transitional, and target menu using the Healthy Eating Index-2005. The average Healthy Eating Index-2005 score for baseline menus compared to target menus increased by more than 50 points with incremental increases observed for each transitional menu. This analysis demonstrates that small, practical changes in food choices that bring consumers closer to meeting {MyPyramid} recommendations result in gradual and dramatic improvements in diet quality. Food and nutrition professionals can use menu modeling to provide concrete examples and specific guidance for making progressive changes in food selections to meet current dietary recommendations.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (1) is designed to provide science-based diet and physical activity recommendations for promoting health and reducing risk of chronic disease. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that following a diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines may reduce the risk of chronic disease (2). Yet, adherence to the Dietary Guidelines and other public health recommendations is low among the {US} population. Estimates suggest as few as 3\% to 4\% of Americans follow all of the Dietary Guidelines recommendations ( [3] and [4]). Food consumption data indicates that consumers must make considerable changes to reach {MyPyramid} goals for solid fats, sugar, the five primary food groups, and the subgroups ( [1] and [5]). Furthermore, intake levels of certain shortfall nutrients are low enough to be of concern for adults, including calcium; potassium; fiber; magnesium; and vitamins A, C, and E (1).

Possible reasons why the Dietary Guidelines and {MyPyramid} Food Guidance System have had a negligible influence on changing dietary behaviors have been proposed (3). These include consumer confusion with the ongoing delivery of sometimes conflicting dietary information, advice that is not adequately individualized to address personal health concerns, and failure to integrate experimental evidence with real-life situations.

Consumer-based research has been conducted to better understand how to successfully communicate concepts from the Dietary Guidelines ( [6], [7] and [8]). A key finding from qualitative research is that consumers want realistic and personalized guidance to help them adopt more healthful eating habits ( [8] and [9]). Consumers say they are looking for practical, motivating, and easy-to-implement strategies that emphasize small steps vs major life changes (9). A national obesity prevention campaign launched in March 2004 by the {US} Department of Health and Human Services is aimed at improving health through diet and physical activity by helping consumers take it one small step at a time (10). The small steps approach has become a popular strategy for encouraging consumers to make gradual changes to meet dietary and physical activity goals. For example, {MyPyramid's} {slogan—Steps} to a Healthier You—suggests that consumers can benefit from taking small steps each day to improve their diet and lifestyle.

Food intake pattern modeling is a method for evaluating nutrient adequacy of proposed food intake patterns and assessing possible effects of recommended changes in food selection for various groups of people (11). It can be used to appraise new nutrient recommendations and determine the need for compensating changes in overall dietary recommendations. Various modeling exercises were performed to develop and evaluate the {MyPyramid} food patterns and determine the effects of potential Dietary Guidelines recommendations on overall dietary adequacy (11).

Menu modeling, a similar technique, was used in our analysis to evaluate actual and recommended food intake patterns using specific foods readily available in supermarkets, including canned, frozen, and convenience products. The purpose of this analysis was to assess the incremental changes in diet quality, as measured by the Healthy Eating Index {(HEI)-2005}, when baseline menus were modified with gradual changes through a series of transitional menus to meet the food and nutrient recommendations of {MyPyramid} and the Dietary Guidelines.

The {HEI-2005} is designed to assess diet quality by measuring compliance of diets with the key, diet-related recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines (12). It is designed for use in nutrition monitoring, evaluation of nutrition interventions, nutrition education, and research (13). The 12 components of the {HEI-2005} include nine adequacy components: the five major food groups plus oils found in {MyPyramid} and three subgroup recommendations (ie, whole fruits, dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, and whole grains). Three moderation components include saturated fat, sodium, and energy from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars. Unlike the previous {HEI}, the {HEI-2005} assesses dietary intakes on a per kilocalorie basis rather than absolute amounts of food consumed; thus, the {HEI-2005} score represents quality of the relative proportions of foods consumed. Component scores are assigned based on how close the diet comes to meeting goals for each of the 12 components. Standards for scoring are described elsewhere (12). The {HEI-2005} was applied to national dietary intake surveys conducted in 1994-96 and in 2001-02 to assess diet quality of Americans before implementation of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines (14). The component scores were below the maximum score possible for all components with the exception of total grains and meat and beans. The overall diet quality changed little between this time period with a consistent score of 58 out of 100 possible, indicating that the diet quality of Americans needs improvement (14). The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion plans to include the {HEI-2005} in a future update of {MyPyramid} Tracker, the Center's dietary assessment and nutrition education tool.

Results of this menu modeling analysis were instrumental in supporting a national in-store nutrition campaign developed by the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Food Marketing Institute, and {MatchPoint} Marketing called Take a Peak into {MyPyramid} (15). Introduced in January 2007, this effort by food manufacturers and retailers to support the 2005 Dietary Guidelines disseminates the nutrition messages of {MyPyramid} at the retail level and identifies foods in grocery stores that provide a meaningful contribution toward meeting the food and nutrient goals of {MyPyramid.}},

Portable hand-held information technology offers much promise not only in assessing dietary intake in the real world, but also in providing dietary feedback to individuals. However, stringent research designs have not been employed to examine whether it can be effective in modifying dietary behaviors. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a hand-held computer (i.e., personal digital assistant {[PDA])} for increasing vegetable and whole-grain intake over 8 weeks in mid-life and older adults, using a randomized study design.
Methods

Twenty-seven healthy adults aged ≥50 were randomized and completed the 8-week study. Intervention participants received an instructional session and a {PDA} programmed to monitor their vegetable and whole-grain intake levels twice per day and to provide daily individualized feedback, goal-setting, and support. Controls received standard, age-appropriate, written nutritional education materials. Dietary intake was assessed via the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire at baseline and 8 weeks.
Results

Relative to controls, intervention participants reported significantly greater increases in vegetable servings (1.5–2.5 servings/day; p=0.02), as well as a trend toward greater intake of dietary fiber from grains (3.7–4.5 servings/day; p=0.10).

	abstract = {In order to assess nutritional adequacy, valid estimates of nutrient intake are required. One of the main errors in dietary assessment is misreporting. The objective was to review the extent, nature and determinants of misreporting in dietary assessment, how this affects reported intakes of micronutrients and how this is identified and measured, and to identify the best ways of dealing with misreporting when interpreting results. A systematic literature search was conducted for studies of misreporting of dietary intake in adults by 24 hour recalls or by estimated or weighed food records, published up to March 2008. Thirty-seven relevant studies were identified. Possible causes of misreporting were identified. Methods most used to identify misreporting were the Goldberg cut-off (46 \% studies) and the doubly labelled water technique (24 \% studies). The magnitude of misreporting of energy intake was similar in all three dietary assessment methods. The percentage of under-reporters was about 30 \% and energy intake was underestimated by approximately 15 \%. Seven papers presented usable data for micronutrient intake. Absolute intakes of Fe, Ca and vitamin C (the three micronutrients addressed in all papers) were on average 30 \% lower in low-energy reporters {(LER)} than that in non-{LER} and, although results were not consistent, there was a tendency for micronutrient density to be higher in {LER.} Excluding underreporters or using energy adjustment methods for micronutrient intakes is discussed. Residual method of energy adjustment seems to be a good tool for practice to decrease an influence of misreporting when interpreting results of studies based on food records and 24 hour recalls.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Estimate effectiveness of goal setting for nutrition and physical activity behavior change, review the effect of goal-setting characteristics on behavior change, and investigate effectiveness of interventions containing goal setting. {DATA} {SOURCE:} For this review, a literature search was conducted for the period January 1977 through December 2003 that included a Current Contents, Biosis Previews, Medline, {PubMed}, {PsycINFO}, and {ERIC} search of databases and a reference list search. Key words were goal, goal setting, nutrition, diet, dietary, physical activity, exercise, behavior change, interventions, and fitness. {STUDY} {INCLUSION} {AND} {EXCLUSION} {CRITERIA:} The search identified 144 studies, of which 28 met inclusion criteria for being published in a peer reviewed journal and using goal setting in an intervention to modify dietary or physical activity behaviors. Excluded from this review were those studies that (1) evaluated goal setting cross-sectionally without an intervention; (2) used goal setting for behavioral disorders, to improve academic achievement, or in sports performance; (3) were reviews. {DATA} {EXTRACTION} {AND} {SYNTHESIS:} The articles were categorized by target audience and secondarily by research focus. Data extracted included outcome measure, research rating, purpose, sample, sample description, assignment, findings, and goal-setting support. {RESULTS:} Thirteen of the 23 adult studies used a goal-setting effectiveness study design and eight produced positive results supporting goal setting. No adolescent or child studies used this design. The results were inconclusive for the studies investigating goal-setting characteristics (n = 7). Four adult and four child intervention evaluation studies showed positive outcomes. No studies reported power calculations, and only 32\% of the studies were rated as fully supporting goal setting. {CONCLUSIONS:} Goal setting has shown some promise in promoting dietary and physical activity behavior change among adults, but methodological issues still need to be resolved. The literature with adolescents and children is limited, and the authors are not aware of any published studies with this audience investigating the independent effect of goal setting on dietary or physical activity behavior. Although, goal setting is widely used with children and adolescents in nutrition interventions, its effectiveness has yet to be reported.},

	abstract = {Three of 4 Americans believe there is too much conflicting information about diet (1). Part of this confusion has to do with the amount of food considered to be a “serving” or a “portion.” Each person has his or her own perceptions of “standard” food portions.

Today's large portions, the norm in many eating establishments, can differ substantially from the 3 key standards for serving sizes: the Food Guide Pyramid (2), the Nutrition Facts Label on food packaging (3), and the Exchange Lists for Meal Planning (4). For example, one large deli bagel might weigh 4 oz, whereas the half bagel listed as a serving in the Food Guide Pyramid and the Exchange Lists weighs about 1 oz. Meanwhile, the serving size listed on the Nutrition Facts Label is 1 bagel (which may vary from 1 oz to more than 4 oz). With so much variation, it is no wonder that consumers are confused about what portions and serving sizes mean and how to use them.

Many factors affect how much people eat, including a person's age, gender, activity level, cultural background, and appetite, not to mention where and when food is obtained and eaten. Most people think of a portion as the amount of a specific food they eat at a meal or for a snack. For example, spaghetti served with meat sauce is often considered a single portion, regardless of the amount served. The large portions offered at restaurants and other food venues suggest to the public that the amount served is a standard portion. In fact, these portions are often 3 to 4 times larger than what is considered standard. For example, a 3-piece chicken dinner provides 3 meat portions; a large submarine sandwich may provide 4 standard bread portions plus other sandwich components.

Several researchers have documented how inaccurate people can be when asked to estimate food portion sizes (5), (6) and (7). When keeping food records, people list foods eaten but usually estimate rather than measure or weigh actual amounts consumed. Misestimations typically result in underreporting the amount of meat, fats, sweets, and alcohol consumed. Thus, nutrient intake calculated from such data often misrepresents actual energy intake and nutrients consumed. Tools such as the Food Guide Pyramid, Nutrition Facts Label, and Exchange Lists can help consumers understand food portions, provide more accurate data for assessment, and make more healthful food choices.},

Mixed dishes, being a mixture of components with varying proportions, prove problematic for categorising and reporting consumption--unlike basic foods, which can be classified into specific food groups relatively easily. For both purchased and homemade mixed dishes, it is advantageous to have a consistent method for assigning dishes to appropriate food groups, while retaining continuity with previous {NDNS} surveys to enable investigation of trends over time. Historically two main methods have been used to classify mixed dishes in the {NDNS} databank: either grouping by meat or fish content, or grouping by the main food component. Neither method is entirely satisfactory. In this study, selected foods were tabulated by both methods to determine which approach should be used in future work. Neither method proved entirely satisfactory alone, and in order to maintain consistency and continuity for the main survey of the new {NDNS} rolling programme, it was decided to take into account elements from both methods and to place comparable recipes together in the same food groups. A varied approach encompassing food names, proportions of ingredients and case-by-case judgement is the most appropriate way to classify mixed food dishes in a nutrient databank.},

players’ fish tanks included other players’ fish, thereby creating an environment of both cooperation and competition. In
a fourteen-week study with nineteen participants, the game served as a catalyst for promoting exercise and for improving game
players’ attitudes towards physical activity. Furthermore, although most player’s enthusiasm in the game decreased after the
game’s first two weeks, analyzing the results using Prochaska’s Transtheoretical Model of Behavioral Change suggests that
individuals had, by that time, established new routines that led to healthier patterns of physical activity in their daily

Pre/post-intervention dietary intake was assessed with 24-h dietary recalls and weight was obtained. Mean number of days participants kept self-monitoring records was determined. The impact of self-monitoring on the change in {GI}, fiber intake, weight and body mass index {(BMI)} was evaluated using regression {analyses.Results}
Each additional day of self-monitoring was associated with a mean reduction in weight and {BMI} of -0.95�kg and -0.34�kg/m2, respectively. The mean change in fiber intake increased in men but did not significantly change in women for each additional day of {monitoring.Conclusion}

Men can self-monitor to lose weight and increase fiber intake. Self-monitoring facilitates weight loss in women but other behavioral strategies are needed to improve fiber intake.},

	abstract = {Although there has been increasing attention to cancer prevention among low-income and minority populations, only a few nutrition interventions have addressed the special needs of people with low literacy skills. To determine the best provider and the most effective format for a nutrition intervention targeting patients with low literacy skills, we conducted interviews with literacy experts and health care providers and focus groups with members of adult basic education classes. Thirty-five literacy experts and health-center-based physicians, nurses, and nutritionists in Boston, Mass, were interviewed. In addition, 50 volunteer clients from 4 Boston-based adult basic education programs participated in 6 focus groups. Results suggested that health care providers consider nutrition to be a fundamental health education topic, but that its successful inculcation in patients with limited literacy skills is hindered mostly by insufficient provider time. Almost all providers agreed that patients need to be referred to nutritionists for nutrition education. Although most providers and patients acknowledged that patients perceive physicians to be the authorities on health, patients with low literacy skills turned first to family members and friends for health information. These results suggest that effective nutrition interventions must build on patients' social networks; appear in a visually based, interactive format; and be culturally appropriate.

Working memory and other supportive cognitive processes involved in learning are reviewed in the context of developing patient education materials.

A selective review of relevant cognitive and learning theories is discussed with regard to their potential impact on the optimal design of health {materials.Results}
Working memory is measured as an individual's capacity to hold and manipulate information in active consciousness. It is limited by necessity, and well-designed health materials can effectively minimize extraneous cognitive demands placed on individuals, making working memory resources more available to better process content-related {information.Conclusions}
Further research is needed to evaluate specific design principles and identify ideal uses of print versus video-based forms of communication for conveying {information.Practice} implications
The process of developing health materials should account for the cognitive demands that extrinsic factors such as modality place on patients.},

A cross-sectional sample of 153 female elementary school teachers (3rd to 5th grades) completed a 7 consecutive day food record. The main outcome measures included number of servings of fruit and vegetables, low-fat practices, and high-fat practices per day. Three models were tested for between-day correlations (compound symmetric, heterogenous compound symmetric, and unstructured); an intraclass correlation was calculated across days for reliability; the number of days of recording necessary to achieve a reliability of .7, .8, or .9 was estimated; and implications of separate covariance structures for weekdays versus weekend days were explored. The compound symmetry model characterized weekdays for fruit and vegetables and the number of high-fat practices when a square root transformation was employed. Five days are adequate for assessing servings of fruit and vegetables for weekdays at a reliability of .8 but 4 weekend days are necessary for the same reliability on weekends. Seven days of recording are necessary to assess high-fat practices at a reliability of .8. To attain a reliability of .8 or higher, 7 days of recording are necessary for estimating high-fat practices; 9 consecutive days, beginning on a Saturday, are necessary for fruit and vegetables. Because of the large proportion of days with zero values, caution must be used to estimate number of days needed to reliably estimate number of low-fat practices per day.}

As the study progressed the self-monitoring rate declined to 59\% by spring 2000. Participants were challenged by inability to accurately estimate fat content of restaurant foods and the inconvenience of carrying bulky self-monitoring tools. In 1996, a Self-Monitoring Working Group was organized to develop additional self-monitoring options that were responsive to participant needs. This article describes the original and additional self-monitoring tools and trends in tool use over time. Original tools were the Food Diary and Fat Scan. Additional tools include the Keeping Track of Goals, Quick Scan, Picture Tracker, and Eating Pattern Changes instruments. The additional tools were used by the majority of participants (5,353 of 10,260 or 52\% of participants who were self-monitoring) by spring 2000. Developing self-monitoring tools that are responsive to participant needs increases the likelihood that self-monitoring can enhance dietary reporting adherence, especially in long-term clinical trials.}

	abstract = {The scientific community has long been interested in the overall quality of diets owing to the fact that it is important for each individual's health through a healthy, varied, and balanced diet. Much research has been conducted on methods used to measure dietary quality. These studies led to the determination of numerous indices, some very simple and some much more complex. Indices that examine diets for several attributes concurrently are able to provide a measure of overall diet quality that is not possible when only single nutrients or food groups are examined. Using these indices, diet quality may be evaluated in relation to nutrient adequacy, compliance with dietary guidelines, or nutrition recommendations, association with risk of chronic diseases, or mortality, and used to assess interventions. However, there are several factors that should be taken into consideration for the design of an index, like the purpose of its use, as well as its simplicity in daily practice. The general purpose of an index is to synthesize a large amount of information into a single useful indicator. The purpose of this review was to present and to critically review the most commonly used dietary indices, and how they reflect various aspects of diet quality. The majority of these indices fail to recognize the various inter-relationships between their components, as well as their accuracy for estimating specific health outcomes. Thus, the development of weighted dietary indices that adequately assess a dietary pattern and its relationship to the burden of a disease is considered essential.},

	abstract = {Medical informatics, broadly defined as the integration of information technology in healthcare, is revolutionizing all aspects of medicine from electronic medical record systems to portable systems that assist clinicians with medical decision-making and data entry. The human-computer interface issues in medical informatics are particularly interesting because there are often diverse user groups with different requirements for the same application (i.e., clinicians and patients).

In this dissertation, I present studies that inform the design of the Dietary Intake Monitoring Application {(DIMA)}, a patient-centered application designed to assist dialysis patients in monitoring their dietary needs. Dialysis patients who do not comply with their dietary restrictions run the risk of undergoing additional emergency dialysis, hypertension, pulmonary edema, and death. Currently, patients try to remember their fluid and sodium consumption or record it in a food diary. However, these techniques fail in 80\% of dialysis patients. We provide patients with a personal digital assistant application to record their fluid and sodium intake.

The varying levels of patient literacy and computing skills present a challenge for the design of {DIMA.} Furthermore, evaluating {DIMA} is a challenge because user studies must be conducted in dialysis wards, which are small, stressful, prohibit audio/video recordings, and change rapidly without warning. This dissertation presents methods to make patients more comfortable using {DIMA} in their everyday lives, a framework for usability studies in non-traditional environments, and interface design guidelines for people with varying literacy skills.},

The program needs to appropriately balance the level of detail used with the burden load on respondents and errors associated with categorisation of foods into groups. Various statistical techniques were utilised to aggregate a large number of food items into compositionally and conceptually similar groups. Exploratory statistical analysis, cluster analysis, stepwise regression analysis and association rule analysis were performed. A database containing 433 food groups was created which minimised the level of database error in the resulting data collection. Although some database error was introduced by aggregating food items into groups, the magnitude of the errors was reasonable considering other error sources. These findings are useful when applied to collection of food intake information for an individual's diet history and measurement of energy and macronutrient intake.},

Design Adult women were randomized into a control group and an experimental group for comparison of training technique.
Setting University and research center.
Subjects Five hundred women were screened using the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire to identify restrained eaters or disinhibitors. Other criteria for selection included good health; absence of thyroid, respiratory, or other diseases; normal menstrual cycles; between the ages of 18 and 50 years. Forty-nine were recruited, with an attrition rate of 10\% for a total sample of 44 subject.
Intervention The control group (n=26) was trained with food models and the experimental group (n=18) was trained with a combination of food models and life-sized food photographs. All subjects completed two 24-hour recalls and 14 consecutive days of food records. {TEE} was measured by the doubly-labeled water method.
Main outcome measures Training would improve the accuracy of food portion estimates.
Statistical analyses performed Analysis of variance, the paired t test, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and Wilcoxon's ranking test.
Results The mean reported intake between instruments was found to be reliable; however, the comparison with {TEE} was underreported by 21.4\% and was thus nonvalid. Training technique made no difference in validity or reliability. Both training techniques improved the accuracy of food portion estimates; however, improvement was enhanced with food photographs.
Applications/conclusion The findings indicate that training can improve food portion estimates, and dietary instruments may provide reliable but nonvalid results.}

	abstract = {Previously, it has been demonstrated that overeating can occur when an individual engages in a cognitive task during a meal. One possibility, therefore, is that task performance can provide a measure of attention to dietary control. To explore this idea we measured performance on an otherwise irrelevant task during a meal. In two experiments, we compared intake and performance across five groups of females; dieters, and four groups of non-dieters, each with contrasting high and low scores on the restraint scale of the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire and the disinhibition scale of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Our analysis suggests that a correspondence can exist between task performance and intake {(Experiment} 1) and this might be influenced by the extent to which foods are regarded as forbidden {(Experiment} 2). However, aspects of our data are difficult to reconcile with the idea that task performance reflects a simple measure of attention to dietary control. Instead, one possibility is that individuals differ in the way that they choose to allocate attention during a meal. In relation to this idea, we discuss the possibility that some individuals choose to avoid food-related cognition by engaging strategically with other aspects of their cognitive environment.},

An interagency working group based the {HEI-2005} on the food patterns found in {MyPyramid.} Diets that meet the least restrictive of the food-group recommendations, expressed on a per 1,000 calorie basis, receive maximum scores for the nine adequacy components of the index: total fruit (5 points), whole fruit (5 points), total vegetables (5 points), dark green and orange vegetables and legumes (5 points), total grains (5 points), whole grains (5 points), milk (10 points), meat and beans (10 points), and oils (10 points). Lesser amounts are prorated linearly. Population probability densities were examined when setting the standards for minimum and maximum scores for the three moderation components: saturated fat (10 points), sodium (10 points), and calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages (ie, beer, wine, and distilled spirits), and added sugars (20 points). Calories from solid fats, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars is a proxy for the discretionary calorie allowance. The 2005 Dietary Guideline for saturated fat and the Adequate Intake and Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium, expressed per 1,000 calories, were used when setting the standards for those components. Intakes between the maximum and minimum standards are prorated. The {HEI-2005} is a measure of diet quality as described by the key diet-related recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines. It has a variety of potential uses, including monitoring the diet quality of the {US} population and subpopulations, evaluation of interventions, and research.},

	abstract = {Presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

	abstract = {Self-monitoring is the centerpiece of behavioral weight loss intervention programs. This article presents a systematic review of the literature on three components of self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss studies: diet, exercise, and self-weighing. This review included articles that were published between 1993 and 2009 that reported on the relationship between weight loss and these self-monitoring strategies. Of the 22 studies identified, 15 focused on dietary self-monitoring, one on self-monitoring exercise, and six on self-weighing. A wide array of methods was used to perform self-monitoring; the paper diary was used most often. Adherence to self-monitoring was reported most frequently as the number of diaries completed or the frequency of log-ins or reported weights. The use of technology, which included the Internet, personal digital assistants, and electronic digital scales were reported in five studies. Descriptive designs were used in the earlier studies whereas more recent reports involved prospective studies and randomized trials that examined the effect of self-monitoring on weight loss. A significant association between self-monitoring and weight loss was consistently found; however, the level of evidence was weak because of methodologic limitations. The most significant limitations of the reviewed studies were the homogenous samples and reliance on self-report. In all but two studies, the samples were predominantly white and women. This review highlights the need for studies in more diverse populations, for objective measures of adherence to self-monitoring, and for studies that establish the required dose of self-monitoring for successful outcomes.},
